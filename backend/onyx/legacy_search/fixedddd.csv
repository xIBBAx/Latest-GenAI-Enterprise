 CAV on: 07/07/2020 Pronounced on:01/09/2020 
 1. Heard learned counsel for the parties through V.C. Since both these writ applications are interconnected; as such, the same are being disposed of by this common order. 
 
 2. W.P. (S) No. 136 of 2016 has been preferred by the petitioner for quashing the office order as contained in memo no.4532 dated 29.10.2015, passed by the District Superintendent of Education, Dhanbad (Respondent No.4), whereby the petitioner has been dismissed from service with retrospective effect i.e. 21.10.2008, after the petitioner stood retired on 30.04.15 from the post of2Assistant Teacher and also for payment of all consequential benefits after quashing the impugned order. 
 
 3. W.P.(S) No. 4669 of 2015 has been preferred by the petitioner for direction upon the respondent Authorities to pay all pensionary benefits including pension, gratuity, leave encashment, provident fund and other admissible outstanding dues on account of retirement of the petitioner on 30.04.2015 from the post of Assistant Teacher, Middle School, Ratanpur, Govindpur-02, Dhanbad and also to pay the salary after deducting the subsistence allowance from 24.11.2008 to 30.04.2015 inasmuch as, the petitioner was put under suspension on 24.11.2008 and retired on 30.04.2015 without conclusion of the departmental proceeding. 
 
 4. Brief factual matrix relevant for disposal of the matter as disclosed in the writ applications are that the petitioner was appointed as Assistant Teacher on 20.04.1977. In the year 1995, a case was instituted against him being Govindpur (Barwadda) P.S. Case No.355 of 1992, registered underSections 302/307/149and341of the Indian Penal Code in which he was convicted on 14.10.2008 and was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life on 21.10.2008. However, he was released on bail by this Court vide order dated 10.10.2014 passed in Criminal Appeal No.03 of 2009 filed by the petitioner, which is still pending before this Court. The petitioner was put under suspension on 24.11.2008 (Annexure-1) and a departmental proceeding was initiated against him by framing memo of charge on 31.03.2015 (Annexure-2) and he was directed to submit his reply to the memo of charge on 08.04.2015 (Annexure-3). Thereafter, on 11.04.2015, the petitioner responded to the letter dated 08.04.2015 and submitted his reply to the memo of charge on 21.04.2015 (Annexure-5). During pendency of the proceeding, the petitioner retired from service on 30.04.2015 while he was3posted as Assistant Teacher, Middle School, Ratanpur, Govindpur-02, Dhanbad. On 27.05.2015 (Annexure-6), the petitioner submitted all the relevant papers for payment of his pensionary benefits, but however, with no effect. The specific case of the petitioner is that he has been dismissed from service retrospectively w.e.f. 21.10.2008 i.e. the date of sentence after conviction, by the impugned office order dated 29.10.2015 (Annexure-7). 
 
 5. Mr. Manoj Tandon, learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the office order dated 29.10.2015 passed by the Respondent No.4 whereby the petitioner has been dismissed from his services with retrospective effect is totally against the settled principle of law as dismissal order cannot be passed retrospectively. Learned counsel further contended that since the petitioner has been superannuated on 30.04.2015 and he was dismissed from his services on 29.10.2015 as such, the petitioner is entitled to get all the consequential/retiral benefits payable to him. He further contended that an act done by the petitioner in his private capacity and not involving discharge of his official duty could not amount to an act of moral turpitude. He further contended that retiral benefit cannot be withheld under Rule 43 of the Bihar Pension Rules, as Rule 43(b) of the Bihar Pension Rules specifically provides the right of withholding or withdrawing any pension or any part of it, if a pecuniary loss has been caused to the Government and it is incumbent upon the authorities to issue a show cause notice and to hear the convicted ex-employee before passing an order under Rule 43(b) of the Bihar Pension Rules. He further contended that the petitioner could not have been dismissed as the same is barred underArticle 311(2)of the Constitution of India. Learned counsel concluded his argument by submitting that continuation of departmental proceeding and order of punishment after superannuation of the petitioner is wholly unjustified and against the provisions4of law. In order to buttress his argument, learned counsel relied on the following judgments: 
 
 (a)Chandra Singh and others v. State of Rajasthan and anotherreported in (2003) 6 SCC 545 (para-38); 
 (b) Dev Prakash Tewari v. U.P. Cooperative Institutional Service Board reported in (2014)7 SCC 260 (Para-8, 9 & 10); 
 
 (c)Bhagirathi Jena v. Board of Directors OSFC & ors. reported in (1999)3 SCC 666 (Para-6 & 7) Learned Counsel also referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble Patna High Court reported in 2007 (1) PLJR 289 [Suresh Kumar v. Union of India & Ors.] wherein the Court held that any dismissal will be bad in law during the pendency of the appeal. Relying on the aforesaid judgments, Mr. Tandon submits that the impugned order deserves to be quashed and set-aside. 
 
 6. Per Contra, Mr. Kaushik Sarkhel, GP-V, appearing on behalf of the Respondents contended that the order of dismissal dated 29.10.2015 passed by Respondent no. No.4 is not bad in law as the petitioner has been convicted for committing an offence undersection 302/149of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment along with a fine of Rs.1000/- on 21.10.2008. He contended that the issue involved in this case is well settled that if an employee is convicted for a serious offence involving moral turpitude then only on that ground, the employee can be dismissed from his/her service. He further submits that the moment he was convicted, he seizes to become a public servant. He further submits that the full bench of the Hon'ble Patna High Court in the case of Sarju Prasad Singh v The State of Bihar& Ors. reported in (1986) PLJR 285, the Hon'ble Court has held that the criminal charge of substantive murder undersection 302of the Indian Penal Code involves moral turpitude. It has been further submitted by the learned counsel for the State respondents that5though the petitioner was convicted for the offence undersection 302of the Indian Penal Code on 21.10.2008, but the petitioner has never informed the Respondent Authorities or the school where he was Assistant Teacher regarding such conviction and this fact will be evident from Annexure-1 of the writ petition which is the suspension letter issued by the Respondent No.4 dated 24.11.2008. In the said letter it has been mentioned that on the basis of the letter written by the petitioner and the letter issued by Area Education Officer, Govindpur, it has been brought to the notice of the Respondent No.4 that the petitioner has been made an accused in connection with Barwadda P.S. Case No.413 of 1995 for which he remained in custody and as such, the petitioner has been suspended. This very letter clearly indicates the fact that the Respondent No.4 was not aware of the conviction of the petitioner dated 21.10.2008 and the authorities came to know about such conviction only in the year 2015, which will be evident from Annexure-3 of the Writ Petition. 
 
 7. It is next submitted by the Respondents that the petitioner has not annexed any letter to show that the petitioner has superannuated on 30.04.2015 rather a statement has been made in paragraph-13 of the Writ Petition that the petitioner has retired on 30.04.2015. It is further relevant to mention here that a Departmental Proceedings was initiated against the petitioner on 31.03.2015 and Memo of Charge was also served upon the petitioner and thereafter an inquiry officer was appointed on 08.04.2015 and the petitioner filed his written statement of defence on 21.04.2015 and the order of dismissal was passed on 29.10.2015 and even in the order of dismissal it has not been mentioned that the petitioner has superannuated on 30.04.2015; as such, the contention of the petitioner that the petitioner has retired from service on 30.04.2015 cannot be accepted as there is no document that has been annexed by the petitioner to prove the same.6 
 8. It is further contended by the Respondents that once an employee is convicted of a serious offence involving moral turpitude then it permits the disciplinary authority to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the employee and ought to take appropriate steps to his/her dismissal/removal only on the basis of such conviction. 
 
 9. In support of his contentions, learned counsel for the Respondents rely on the following judgments:- 
 a. (2010) 8 SCC 573 [in the case of Sushil Kumar Singhal v Regional Manager PNB (Paragraphs-18, 21 & 24)]; 
 b. (1996) 4 SCC 17 [in the case of Pawan Kumar v State of Haryana & another]; 
 c. (1997) 4 SCC 1 [in the case of Allahabad Bank & another v Deepak Kumar Bhola]; 
 d. 2013 (3) PLJR 608 [in the case of Subrata Basu v State of Bihar & Ors.]. 
 10. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and after going through the materials available on record, following issues emerge for adjudication:- 
 Issue no. (i) Whether continuation of departmental proceeding and order of punishment even after superannuation of the delinquent is justified? 
 Issue no. (ii) Whether the petitioner is entitled/covered by the protection guaranteed underArticle 311(2)of the Constitution of India? 
 Issue no. (iii) Whether after conviction for an offence involving moral turpitude it is incumbent upon the authorities to issue any show cause notice and to hear the convicted ex-employee before passing an order under Rule 43(b) of the Bihar Pension Rules? 
 Issue no. (iv) Whether in the facts and circumstances of this case, the dismissal of the petitioner retrospectively w.e.f. the date of conviction by competent Court is justified ? 
 11. It appears that the petitioner was appointed as Assistant Teacher on 20.04.1977 and in the year 1995, a criminal case has been instituted against him for the offence committed underSections 302/307/149and341of the Indian Penal Code and in the said criminal proceedings he was convicted and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life. Thereafter, the petitioner was put under suspension on 24.11.2008. The fact further transpires that the petitioner was released on bail by this Court vide order dated 10.10.2014 in Criminal Appeal No.03 of 2009. A departmental proceeding was also initiated against the petitioner in which he was dismissed from service retrospectively w.e.f. 21.10.2008 by the impugned office order dated 29.10.2015 (Annexure-7). 
 12. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that continuation of departmental proceedings and order of punishment after his superannuation is wholly unjustified and against the provisions of law and the question of imposing major penalty of dismissal after his superannuation would not arise. In this regard reference may be made to the Judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case ofTakhatray Shivadattaray Mankad V. State of Gujaratreported in 1989 Supp (2) SCC 110. In the said case the question of departmental inquiry instituted before retirement and its continuation after the age of superannuation was considered. It was held that proceedings could be continued under the relevant rules, and as provided, the order could have been passed with respect to pension and gratuity. The proceedings did not become infructuous. Recently also, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Chairman-cum-Managing Director, Mahanadi Coalfields Limited -versus- Rabindranath Choubey reported in 2020 SCC online SC 470 has held that the disciplinary authority has powers to impose penalty of dismissal upon the delinquent even after his attaining the age of superannuation. Relevant portion of Para-70 & 72 are quoted herein below:- 
 
 ""70. .......................... It would be against the public policy to permit an employee to go scot-free after collecting various service benefits to which he would not be entitled, and the event of superannuation cannot come to his rescue and would amount to condonation of guilt. Because of the legal fiction provided under the rules, it can be completed in the same manner as if the employee had remained in service after superannuation, and appropriate punishment can be imposed."" 
 ""72. .................................................................. (2) the disciplinary authority has powers to impose the penalty of dismissal/major penalty upon the respondent even after his attaining the age of superannuation, as the disciplinary proceedings were initiated while the employee was in service."" 
 13. The aforesaid judgment has clearly laid down the legal position that the departmental proceedings do not lapse and become infructuous and punishment, as may be considered appropriate, can be imposed in terms of relevant rules. As such the issue no.(1) is decided against the petitioner. 
 
 14. It has been argued on behalf of the petitioner that the petitioner could not have been dismissed as the same is barred underArticle 311(2)of the Constitution of India. This aspect has been dealt by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Deputy Director of Collegiate Education (Administration) Madras v S Nagoor Meera reported in AIR 1995 SC 1364 wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has laid down the law in paragraph-9 as under:- 
 
 ""The Tribunal seems to be of the opinion that until the appeal against the conviction is disposed of action under clause (a) of the second proviso toArticle 311(2)is not permissible. We see no basis or justification for the said view. The more appropriate course in all such cases is to take action under Clause (a) of the second proviso toArticle 311(2)once a government servant is convicted of a criminal charge and not to wait for the appeal or revision, as the case may be. If, however, the government servant- accused is acquitted on appeal or other proceeding, the order can always be revised and if the government servant is reinstated, he will be entitled to all the benefits to which9he would have been entitled to had he continued in service. The other course suggested, viz., to wait till the appeal, revision and other remedies are over, would not be advisable since it would mean continuing in service a person who has been convicted of a serious offence by a criminal court. It should be remembered that the action under Clause (a) of the second proviso toArticle 311(2)will be taken only where the conduct which has led to his conviction is such that it deserves any of the three major punishments mentioned inArticle 311(2).As held by his court in Shankardass v. Union of India [1985] 2 S.C.R. 358: 
 Clause (a) of the second proviso toArticle 311(2)of the Constitution confers on the government the power to dismiss a person from service ""on the ground of conduct which has led to his conviction on a criminal charge"". But that power like every other power has to be exercised fairly, justly and reasonably. Surely, the Constitution does not contemplated that a government servant who is convicted for parking his scooter in a no-parking area should be dismissed from service. He may perhaps not be entitled to be heard on the question of penalty since Clause (a) of the second proviso toArticle 311(2)makes the provisions of that article inapplicable when a penalty is to be imposed on a Government servant on the ground of conduct which has led to his conviction on a criminal charge. But the right to impose a penalty carries with it the duty to act justly."" 
 15. In the present case, admittedly, the petitioner has been convicted for the offence undersection 302of the Indian Penal Code which is a serious offence as also offence involving moral turpitude as such, the petitioner cannot claim the benefits ofArticle 311(2)of the Constitution of India and further according to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Deputy Director of Collegiate Education (Administration) Madras v S Nagoor Meera (Supra), until the said conviction of the petitioner is set aside by the Appellate Court or Higher Court may not be advisable to retain such person in service and if the10petitioner succeeds in appeal on other proceedings the matter can always be reviewed in such a manner that the petitioner suffers no prejudice. In view of the aforesaid legal position, issue no.(ii) is also decided against the petitioner as the petitioner cannot claim benefits ofArticle 311(2)in view of Clause-(a) of second proviso toArticle 311(2)of the Constitution of India. 
 
 16. It has also been argued by Mr. Tandon with regard to the prayer made by the petitioner that he may be granted all consequential benefits. It has been vehemently contended that retiral benefit cannot be withheld under Rule 43 of the Bihar Pension Rules as Rule 43(b) of the Bihar Pension Rules specifically provides that right of withholding or withdrawing any pension or any part of it, if a pecuniary loss has been caused to the Government is found in a departmental or a judicial proceeding to have been guilty of grave misconduct ought to have caused pecuniary loss to the Government by misconduct or by negligence during his service rendered on re-employment after retirement. 
 
 I am not in agreement with this contention of the learned counsel of the petitioner for the sole reason that Rule 43(a) of the Bihar Pension Rules clearly provides that pension can be withheld if a person has been convicted of a serious crime and in the present case, the petitioner has been convicted undersection 302of the Indian Penal code and as such, the aforesaid submission of the petitioner is totally misconceived. 
 
 17. It has been further contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the main question to be considered whether after such conviction it is incumbent upon the authorities to issue any show cause notice and to hear the convicted ex- employee before passing an order under Rule 43(b) of the Bihar Pension Rules.11 
 From perusal of the provision under Rule 43(b), it does not appear that any such procedure is required to be followed; the said Rule only consist upon a proper opportunity to an employee in a full fledged departmental proceeding before arriving at a finding of misconduct upon which order of withholding pension is made. With regard to judicial proceeding, no such procedure is required as the very functioning of a criminal court is such that maximum opportunity of hearing is provided to a person and finding of guilt is recorded if the charges are proved beyond reasonable doubt. Once a finding is recorded either in a departmental or judicial proceeding, there is no further requirement in the said Rule of giving a further opportunity to the concerned employee. The same is not required even when a punishment is imposed while he is still in service after the 42nd amendment of the Constitution of India inArticle 311.If no such further opportunity to represent in the Departmental Proceeding is required. so far as the quantum of punishment is concerned or even with respect to passing an order of withholding the whole or part of the pension, then no question arises that how after conviction by a court of law, such opportunity would be required. This principle of law has been reiterated by the Hon'ble Patna High Court in the case ofChintamani Sinha & Ors. v. State of Bihar & Ors. reported in 2013 (1) PLJR 439 wherein at para-15 the law has been laid down as under:- 
 ""15. I have considered the submissions of learned counsels for the parties. It is evident from the facts of the present case that the original petitioner not only had been charged of having committed the criminal offence of murder while he was still in service and remained in jail continuously both at the time of trial and for almost five years after his conviction after filing Criminal Appeal in the year 2004 and he was finally released on bail by order dated 20.5.2009 of this Court. The offence of committing murder as per the Full Bench decision of this Court in Sarju Prasad Singh's case (supra) involves moral turpitude and thus conviction underSection 302IPC by itself would have been sufficient, if the said order has been passed while the petitioner was still in service, for dismissal of the petitioner from service in terms of the Service Rules as also the provisions ofArticle 311of the12Constitution without holding any further departmental enquiry against the petitioner."" 
 18. Thus, issue no.(iii) is also decided against the petitioner. 
 19. Learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently contended that the office order dated 29.10.2015 passed by the Respondent No.4 whereby the petitioner has been dismissed from his services with retrospective effect is totally against the settled principle of law as dismissal order cannot be passed retrospectively. He further argued that an act done by the petitioner in his private capacity and not involving discharge of his official duty could not amount to an act of moral turpitude 
 20. It is well settled proposition of law that if an employee is convicted for a serious offence involving moral turpitude then only on that ground, he can be dismissed from his/her services. The moment a person is convicted, he seizes to become a public servant. A Government Servant in terms of Rule 3 of the Bihar Service Conduct Rules is required to maintain absolute integrity, devotion to duty and to do nothing which is unbecoming of a Government Servant. It was this aspect of the matter which was considered by the full bench of Hon'ble Patna High Court in the case of Sarju Prasad Singh v State of Bihar (Supra) wherein it has been held that a Government Servant having been convicted by a Court of competent jurisdiction for criminal charge of murder can be said to have committed an offence involving moral turpitude and as such, conduct of the Government Servant is in violation of Rule 3 of the Bihar Government Service Conduct Rules. The argument of the petitioner that an act done by a Government Servant in his private capacity and not involving discharge of his official duty could not amount to an act of moral turpitude is misconceived. This submission is in teeth of the observation made by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Dayashankar v High Court of Allahabad reported in AIR 1987 SC 1469 where a13Government Servant having been caught using unfair means in the examination, an act which did not relate to discharge of his official duty, was held to be conduct to totally unworthy of the office of a Government Servant. In this regard reference can also be made to the judgment passed by Hon'ble Patna High Court in the case of Subrata Basu reported in 2013(3) PLJR 608 wherein at para-23, the Hon'ble Court has held as under:- 
 
 ""23. As would be noted from perusal of the aforementioned Rules, the amendment in Rule 3(A) by inserting the underlined provision was made by GSR 12 dated 8.8.1990 enabling the competent authority to place a Government servant under suspension on the ground of his facing prosecution for offence underSection 304Bof the Indian Penal Code. Such order of suspension in terms of Rule 3(A)(5) was to remain in force until it was modified or revoked by the competent authority to do so. The order of suspension of the petitioner was passed only during the pendency of his facing criminal trial for offence underSection 304BI.P.C. and, therefore, the life of such suspension order had come to an end when the judgment in the criminal case convicting him for offence underSection 304BI.P.C. and sentencing him to under rigorous imprisonment for life had been passed. In that view of the mater, the respondents were under obligation to consider the case of the petitioner and the competent authority having found the petitioner to have been convicted for offence underSection 304BI.P.C. and other allied offences had dismissed him from service by an order dated 16.11.2001 in keeping with the requirement of proviso A toArticle 311(2)of the Constitution of India laying down automatic dismissal, removal or reduction in rank after conviction of a Government servant. Thus, the recourse taken to by the respondents in passing such an order on 16.11.2001 dismissing the petitioner on account of his being convicted by the competent court cannot be faulted either on fact or in law, inasmuch as, in the facts and circumstances of this case, the petitioner, a life convict for an offence underSection 304(B)IPC, could not have been allowed to continue in service."" 
 21. Learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently argued that the dismissal order cannot be passed retrospectively. In my considered opinion, in the instant case, the order of dismissal in essence is not a case of retrospective termination. The order is only ex post facto recognition of an event that has already been taken14place. The petitioner was already convicted and sentenced on 21.10.08. Recognition of event is naturally ex post facto when after release on Bail in Criminal Appeal, the petitioner represented before the respondent authorities and only then the departmental proceeding was initiated against him. Even otherwise, in the case of Chairman-cum-Managing Director, Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (Supra) the Hon'ble Apex Court has categorically held that the disciplinary authority has powers to impose the penalty of dismissal /major penalty upon the delinquent even after his attaining the age of superannuation; as such, the contention of the petitioner that the dismissal order cannot be passed retrospectively is misconceived and has no force in the eye of law. In view of the aforesaid discussions even the issue no. (iv) is decided against the petitioner. 
 22. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances and discussions made hereinabove, I do not find any error in the impugned order as contained in memo no.4532 dated 29.10.2015 passed by the District Superintendent of Education, Dhanbad (Respondent no.4), whereby the petitioner has been dismissed from service. Further, from para-10 of the counter affidavit dated 25.06.2020 filed in W.P.(S) no. 4669 of 2015, it appears that the petitioner has already received his GPF accumulation amounting to Rs.6,36,070/- and compulsory Group Insurance amount for Rs.1,62,553/- vide bill no.144/2016-17. As such, the petitioner is not entitled for any relief, whatsoever, as prayed for in the aforesaid writ applications. 
 23. Consequently, both these writ applications are hereby dismissed on contest.

 CORAM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ANANDA SEN. 
 ------ 
 FOR THE PETITIONER(S) : Ms. Pravin Shankar Dayal, Advocate FOR THE O.P No.2 : Mr. R.S. Mazumdar, Sr. Adv. 
 Mr. Rohan Mazumdar, Adv. 
 I have heard the counsel for the petitioners in both cases and counsel for the State as well as opposite party. 
 2. Since both these cases are arising out of same FIR and the prayer is common, I am disposing these two applications by a common order. 
 3. These two criminal miscellaneous application has been filed by the respective petitioners praying therein to quash the FIR registered as Govindpur P.S. Case No. 484 of 2015, corresponding to G.R. No. 5840 of 2015 registered underSection 406,420,120BIPC. The case arises out of a complaint being C.P Case No. 2137 of 2015 which was referred underSection 156(3)of the Cr.P.C, by the C.J.M, for registering FIR. Thus, the instant FIR was registered. 
 4. The complaint was initially lodged against Pansri Wasavi Industries limited as accused no.1, Mr. Eswara Rao Gandhi and Prashant Mohan Nayak accused nos. 2 and 3 and also against other three accused persons. The petitioner in Cr.M.P No. 451 of 2016 happens to be the accused No.3 and the petitioner in Cr.M.P No. 479 of 2016 happens to be accused no.2 and is shown to be the Managing Director of accused no.1 company. 
 5. The brief facts, which give rise to the FIR, is that the complainant is a company which manufactures and deals in hard coke and pearl coke. It is alleged that the accused persons approached the complainant and expressed their intention to purchase the products which is manufactured by the complainant. Terms and-2-conditions were settled and it was agreed that prompt payment would be made by the accused persons, after the supply is made. It is alleged that the materials were supplied to the accused persons but the accused persons failed to keep up their promises and did not make payment in terms of the conditions which was agreed upon by the parties. Considerable amount became due against these supply orders. The complainant finding it difficult, stopped supplying hard coke to the accused persons. It has been stated that because of the non-payment of the due amount, the complainant started to face financial loss. It is stated that the accused persons further placed orders for supplying of pearl coke and the same was agreed to be supplied on the condition that the accused persons will issue post-dated cheques. The supply resumed and post-dated cheques were handed over. A verbal request was made by the accused persons to the effect that the cheque should not be presented for clearing and an assurance was given that the amount covered by the cheques would be given to the complainant from time to time and the post-dated cheques would be returned. It is alleged that the total outstanding amount became Rs. 145.56 lakhs. It is further stated that during transaction the accused persons started transferring money in the account of the complainant and requested to return the post-dated cheques as and when the amount was being transferred. These types of practice was adopted by the accused. It is stated that three cheques amounting to Rs. 24,26,000/- each were not deposited by the complainant in the bank as there was an assurance that the said amount would be handed over as per the usual practice but the said amount was not transmitted in the account of complainant, thus the complainant was cheated to the tune of Rs. 72.78 lakhs. He stated that the validity of the cheques in the meantime also expired. The complainant came to learn that the accused persons started purchasing coke from other parties knowing fully well that there is an outstanding amount of Rs. 72.78 lakhs against supply of coke made. The complainant stated that there were three other post-dated cheques lying with the complainant bearing Nos. 227103, 227105 and 227109 which were presented to the bank but the same got dishonoured because of insufficient funds and also because of the drawers signatures differed. It has been mentioned that original authorized signatory was Mr. M.S. Raju and Mr. Kushal Roy but the accused persons by means of a conspiracy, changed the name of the authorised signatory. It has been mentioned that on the aforesaid facts a criminal offence is made out which is punishable-3-underSections 420,406,120BIPC. Thus, the complaint was filed, which was sent underSection 156(3)for registering FIR. 
 6. Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner in both cases submits that from perusal of the complaint no criminal offence is made out. He submits that what are the specific overtact, which constitutes a criminal offence against both the petitioners, has not been mentioned in the complaint petition. He submits that without there being any overtact alleged against the petitioner, these two petitioners cannot be made an accused in this case. He submits that at best an offence underSection 138NI Act is made out because of dishonour of the cheques, but in this case the complainant has filed a complain, resulting in FIR, underSection 406,420IPC which is absolutely a misuse of the process of law. He submits that admittedly there was an on-going business transactions between the parties and when there is an on-going business transactions and there arises a dispute which is infact a money claim in nature, initiation of a criminal proceeding cannot be allowed as the same amounts to abuse of process of court. He submits that FIR was instituted on the direction where the court has exercised power underSection 156(3)Cr.P.C. He submits that none of the procedure laid down underSection 154Cr.P.C has been followed. There is no affidavit filed by the complainant to suggest that he had at all approached the police before filing the complaint. He submits that prayer in the complaint was either to take cognizance or to refer the matter underSection 156(3)Cr.P.C. It is his contention that when the court had exercised his jurisdiction underSection 156(3)Cr.P.C. it was the duty of the court to satisfy itself as to whether the pre- conditions as laid down underSection 154Cr.P.C has been complied or not. In support of submission he relied upon a case of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Priyanka Srivastava & Anr. Vrs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors. reported in (2015) 6 SCC 287. The petitioner further submits that there was business transaction between the parties which is admitted but because of bad financials status of the company i.e accused no.1 the petitioner had to move before the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction which would be evident from Annexure-2 series. It is submitted that there was no intention to cheat the complainant as there is nothing in the entire FIR to suggest that there was an intention to cheat from the very inception of the transaction. 
 7. Mr. R.S. Mazumdar, Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party no.2 submits that the petitioners had an intention to cheat. He submits that when first assurance was given that no sooner the supply is made, the amount would be paid to the complainant but the accused persons failed to honour their promise. It has been further argued that thereafter a negotiation was arrived at between the parties and it was decided that post-dated cheques would be given against supply of materials. He submits that there was an understanding that on receipt of money those post-dated cheques would be handed over back to the accused persons. He submits that three cheques got bounced for insufficiency of fund and also on the ground that the signature differed. He submits that changing the signing authorities suggest that there was a criminal intention of the accused persons. He further submits that accused persons on one hand did not pay the price of the coke which they have taken from the complainant and rather started purchasing material from other sellers which clearly suggests their criminal intention. He submits that it is well settled principle of law that when from a written report or a complaint a cognizable offence is made out, the FIR cannot be quashed. 
 8. The facts giving rise to this case has already been narrated in the foregoing paragraphs of this order. What is evident from the facts is that there was business transaction between the parties. The accused company promised that the price of coke would be paid, no sooner the delivery is completed. Huge amount fell due against the supply. Thus, as per the complainant, the promise to make payment at the earliest, was not honoured by the accused. Later on a new mode of transaction was adopted, where post-dated cheques were given and on deposition of the cheque amount, the respective cheques were returned. Validity of three cheques lapsed, but the amount was not paid and in respect of other three cheques, the same were dishonoured due to insufficiency of fund in bank and also for the reason the company had charged the authorized signatory. Now the question falls for consideration is whether failure to keep promise can be an offence punishable underSections 420&406IPC. 
 9. The question raised has already been answered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of S.W. Palanitkar & Ors. Vrs. State of Bihar & Anr. reported in (2002) 1 SCC 241 the Hon'ble Supreme court in paragraph no.21 of the aforesaid judgment has held that a mere failure to keep up promise subsequently cannot be presumed as an act leading to cheating. In this instant case, we find that there is an allegation that the accused persons and the company had promised that they would pay for the bills no sooner the same were raised but the later on, failed to keep up their promise. Thus, it is the case of the complainant that there was failure on part of the accused-company to keep the promise which it had made. It is also the case of the complainant that a huge amount remained outstanding against various supplies. It is stated that this action has caused loss to the complainant and a corresponding gain to the accused persons. A very important statement has been given in the complaint wherein the complainant has stated that on further request made by the accused persons, the complainant agreed to supply more coke on the conditions of payment of post-dated cheques. This statement clearly suggest that there was ongoing business transaction between the parties. This also suggest that there was no intention to cheat as because if there would have been any intention to cheat or the complainant if at all felt cheated, the complainant could not have been induced to sell and supply further more coke to the accused persons. Further in the complaint petition it has been stated that the supply of coke continued and the outstanding amount came to Rs. 145.56 lakhs till date and this outstanding amount is due to these transactions. It is also admitted in the complaint that the accused persons also started transferring money in the account of the complainant and requested to return the post dated cheques after the amount was transferred and this practice was adopted by the accused persons regarding the payment. These statements clearly suggest that some of the outstanding amounts were continued to be paid by this petitioner's company. Till the date the amounts were paid, there was no dispute. I find that thereafter suddenly the payment was stopped and the cheques could not be deposited by the complainant resulting in expiry of the due date of the cheques but the complainant thereafter deposited the rest three cheques which got dishonoured. 
 10.Section 420of the IPC provides punishment for cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property. Cheating has been defined insection 415of the IPC which reads as follows:- 
 415. cheating:- ""Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to ""cheat"" 
 Explanation.- A dishonest concealment of facts is deception within the meaning of this section."" 
 11. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of G.V Rao Vrs. L.H.V Prasad & Ors. reported in (2000) 3 SCC 693 has held thatsection 415has two part. While in the first part the person must dishonestly or fraudulently induce the complainant to deliver any property, in the second part the person should intentionally induce the complainant to do or omit to do a thing. That is to say, in the first part inducement must be dishonest or fraudulent. In the second part the inducement should be intentional. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has also held that the mens-rea on the part of the persons, must also be established. 
 12. In this case, as seen above, I find that there is an allegation that the promise which was made i.e promise to pay the amount as soon as the bills were raised, was not honoured. This cannot be said to be an intention to cheat. Further from the complaint it is stated that the price was being paid time to time and the post-dated cheques were taken back but thereafter at some point this procedure and the mode which they have adopted failed or not honoured. This also strengthens the fact that there was no intention to cheat. Further it is an admitted case of the parties that the accused company was under Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) and there are several orders passed by the Authority. This suggest that the financial condition of the accused company deteriorated which prevented them from making payment of the amount. 
 13.Section 406IPC provides for punishment for criminal breach of trust. Criminal breach of trust is defined insection 405IPC.Section 403defines dishonest misappropriation of property. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of U. Dhar and Another Vrs. State of Jharkhand & Anr. reported in (2003) 2 SCC 219 has held thatSection 403IPC uses the word ""dishonestly"" and ""misappropriate"". These are the necessary ingredients of an offence underSection 403IPC. Applying the aforesaid provision of law and the facts of this case, I find that neither of these ingredients are satisfied in the facts and circumstances of this case. In this case I find that the transactions arose out of ongoing business transaction between the parties which continued and ultimately at a point of time the dues escalated and the accused company failed to repay the same. Mere failure to repay the dues cannot be said to be a criminal offence. 
 14. I am well aware of the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court which has held that where civil remedy is available, arising out of disputes from a breach of contract, remedy under the criminal law is also not barred if the allegations disclosed the element of criminal offence. The Hon'ble Supreme has also in the case of Binod Kumar & Ors. Vrs. State of Bihar & Anr. reported in (2014) 10 SCC 663 has held that for mere recovery of money, criminal case should not be allowed to proceeded. In this case, the facts which has been narrated, suggest that the dispute is absolutely civil in nature and is infact a money claim. Though there is an allegation of dishonour of cheques, that would come under the provision of underSection 138NI. Act and not underSections 406and420IPC for which the accused can be proceeded against. The complainant has got different remedy under the Negotiable Instruction Act so far as allegation of dishonour of cheque is concerned which he can avail, subject to limitation, but so far as the facts are concerned, I find that there is no ingredients ofSections 406or 420IPCpresent in the entire complaint petition. As there is no ingredients ofSections 406and420IPC in the complaint in hand, I find that this case is covered by the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme court as rendered in the case of Binod Kumar & Ors. (Supra). 
 15. Further I find that this case arises out of a complaint. The complainant had filed a complaint which was registered as C.P Case No. 2137 of 2015. On receipt of the said complaint the Judicial Magistrate, Dhanbad had written on the margin of the complaint that the police to investigate the case as-8-per provision underSection 156(3)Cr.P.C. This is the one line order which was passed by the Magistrate referring the complaint to investigate in terms ofSection 156(3)Cr.P.C. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Priyanka Srivastava & Anr. (Supra) has held that there should be application of mind while passing an order underSection 156(3)Cr.P.C. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has dealt with several judgments and has specifically laid down the law in Paragraph Nos. 20, 21 and 27 of the aforesaid judgment. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Paragraph No. 27 has held that the Magistrate has to remain vigilant with regard to the allegations made and the nature of allegations and not to issue directions without proper application of mind. He has also to bear in mind that sending the matter would be conducive to justice and then he may pass the requisite order. Further it has been held that the said application which has been filed underSection 156(3)Cr.P.C. should be supported by an affidavit and the purpose of filing such affidavit is to prevent abuse of the process which has become more common these days. When I go through the instant case and the complaint petition I find that there is no affidavit annexed along with the said complaint petition. I find that there was no prior invocation ofSection 154(3)while filing this petition before the court underSection 156(3). Thus, this order and the action of the Magistrate, sending the complaint to the police station for investigation 156(3)Cr.P.Cand registering an FIR is not in consonance with the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. In this score also the order registering the FIR which has been passed by the Magistrate is also absolutely bad. 
 16. Thus, in terms of what has been discussed and held above, I find merits in this application. This application therefore stands allowed and the criminal case being Govindpur P.S. Case No. 484 of 2015, corresponding to G.R. No. 5840 of 2015 is hereby quashed.

 CAV on: 10/07/2020, Pronounced on: 01/09/2020 Heard learned counsel for the parties through V.C. 
 2. The instant application has been preferred by the petitioner for quashing and setting aside the order dated 01.02.2012, whereby the petitioner has been awarded punishment of dismissal and also for quashing and setting aside the order dated 08.07.2011, whereby the petitioner has been awarded punishment of withholding of two increments. 
 
 3. At the outset, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that he has been awarded two punishments; one is removal from service and the other is for withholding of 2 increments, in two separate proceeding but for the same set of charges and for similar cause of action. He further contended that the order of dismissal is for the charge that the petitioner had consummated second marriage during the existence of first marriage and the order for withholding of two increments is for the charge of not properly looking after his first wife and two children and having extra marital relationship with another lady. 
 
 4. The facts of the case lie in a narrow compass. The petitioner has been departmentally proceeded vide Departmental Proceeding No.30 of 2007, issued by the respondent No.3 when he was posted as police constable of STF and deputed in Sahibganj. In the said departmental proceeding, the petitioner has been dismissed from service vide order dated 01.02.2012. The petitioner was also earlier awarded punishment vide order 08.07.2011 in Departmental Proceeding No.39 of 2010, on the charge that he is not looking after his first wife and children and living with another lady having illegal relationship. 
 
 5. The case of the petitioner is that when the cause of action is almost same and similar, there is no ground for initiating two proceedings and awarding two different punishments. 
 
 6. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the punishment order of withholding of increments in pay was passed on 08.07.2011 in the subsequent Departmental Proceeding No.39/2010, whereas the dismissal order has been passed in the earlier proceeding on 01.02.2012 i.e. after more than 6 months from the earlier order of punishment. He further contended that the above mentioned two punishment orders is hit by the principle of double jeopardy which violates individual natural rights and also principle of civil jurisprudence. 
 
 7. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that the wife of the petitioner has never constituted any case under Section 498 A or 494of the Indian Penal Codeagainst the petitioner and it is only on the basis of Newspaper publication, Departmental Proceeding No.30 of 2007 was initiated. 
 
 8. Learned counsel for the petitioner further contended that the order of dismissal from service is also excessive inasmuch as in similar charges the other officers were awarded lesser punishment like Nindan (Censor), forfeiture of increments or reduction of pay scale on initial pay but in the instant case for similar offence, the petitioner has3been dismissed from service. He further referred paragraph Nos. 7, 8 and 9 of the rejoinder which has not been controverted by the counsel for the respondent. 
 9. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent opposed the prayer of the petitioner and submits that being a Government servant that too in a disciplined force, the petitioner ought not to have committed such offence and the offence is against Rule 23 of the Conduct Rules, 1976, as such, no leniency should be granted to the petitioner. However, he could not controvert the specific submissions and statements made in the rejoinder affidavit filed the petitioner that in same and similar situation the other officials were awarded lesser punishment and not removal from service. 
 10. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties at length and after perusing the materials available on record, it is not in dispute that the petitioner is having extra marital relationship with other lady during the life time of his first wife but the first wife remained mum over the issue and did not make any complaint. The matter cropped up only on the basis of paper publication in ""Dainik Jagran"" and ""Hindustan Daily"" on 16.05.2007. It is also not in dispute that a proceeding was previously initiated against the petitioner for not keeping his wife and children in good condition and having extra marital relationship with another woman in which the petitioner was also awarded punishment of lowering down two increments. 
 
 11. It is true and a well settled law that bigamy is legally barred under the Hindu Law but for the same offence the petitioner has cited few orders which is annexed as Annexure 8, 9 and 10 of rejoinder in which lesser punishment has been awarded to those delinquents and the said submission has not been controverted by the respondent State. Hence, the said submission and statement made in the rejoinder to that effect remains intact on the doctrine of non traverse. 
 
 12. Though generally Court precludes from interfering with the impugned order, unless the punishment order is one which shocks the conscience of the Court and the4case in hand, the impugned order for dismissal dated 01.02.2012, appears to be shockingly disproportionate and not commensurate with the charges, hence, on the ground of doctrine of proportionality, the instant application needs interference. 
 13. In view of the aforesaid facts and discussions, especially the fact that the petitioner was already awarded punishment of lowering down 2 increments on almost same set of allegations, the impugned order dated 01.02.2012 issued by the respondent No.3, whereby the petitioner has been dismissed from service, is hereby quashed and set aside and the instant application is remitted back to the respondent No.3 to pass fresh order on the ground of parity and doctrine of proportionality within a period of 12 weeks from the date of receipt of this order. 
 
 15. With the aforesaid observations and directions, the instant writ application is allowed and disposed of.

 Oral Order 05 / Dated : 01.09.2020 I.A. No. 534 of 2020 This interlocutory application has been filed for condoning the delay of 58 days, which has occurred in preferring the present appeal. 
 Having heard learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the averments made in the application, we are of the view that the appellants were prevented by sufficient cause from preferring the appeal within the period of limitation. 
 Accordingly, the delay of 58 days in preferring the present appeal is hereby condoned and this application stands allowed. L. P. A. No. 709 of 2018 Heard learned counsel for the appellants and the respondents. 
 There is no iota of doubt from any angle that there was no requirement of filing this appeal by the writ petitioners as the learned Single Judge has already granted sufficient time to hand over the possession of the respective quarters to the respondents and direction was given to release the gratuity along with interest payable to the writ petitioners. Still the writ petitioners did not vacate the quarters though they gave undertakings that they will vacate it rather they have filed this appeal and remained further in occupation of the quarter for about two years unauthorizedly. Thus, in our opinion, they are4.liable to pay rent for unauthorized period of occupation in view of the decision rendered in Ram Naresh Singh Vs. Bokaro Steel Ltd. and others (Civil Appeal No. 4740 of 2017) passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and a decision passed by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Steel Authority of India Limited & Ors Vs. Sada Nand Singh (L.P.A. No. 733 of 2018 and analogous cases). 
 In view of the conduct of the writ petitioners-appellants also, we are not persuaded to intervene in the matter as they would be required to vacate the quarter. We were also of the opinion to impose heavy cost and penal rent in view of their conduct but at the time of hearing learned counsel for the appellants has urged before us that all of them are retired persons and they would face great hardship if such type of direction or order is passed. In that view of the matter, we are refraining ourselves from imposing of penal rent but as per the decision rendered by the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Steel Authority of India Limited & Ors Versus Sada Nand Singh (L.P.A. No. 733 of 2018 and analogous cases) following the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ram Naresh Singh Vs. Bokaro Steel Ltd. and others (Civil Appeal No. 4740 of 2017), the writ petitioners would be required to pay rent at the normal rate if they vacate the quarters within a period of four weeks from today. They will also have to pay the rent at normal rate for the unauthorised period of occupation which shall5.be calculated by the respondents and would be supplied to the writ petitioners along with the electricity and water charges, if payable. 
 In case of non-compliance of the direction, i.e., if they do not vacate the quarter within a period of four weeks from today and do not pay the calculated rent at normal rate within a period of three months from the date of the same being raised then in such case they would be liable to pay penal rent fixed in accordance with law by the respondents authorities. If they do not vacate the quarters then the authorities would be at liberty to get them vacated through the process of law and recover penal rent also. 
 However, it is made clear that the aforesaid would have no connection with the release of gratuity and payment of statutory interest upon the gratuity amount as per law. 
 Accordingly, this appeal stands disposed of.

 JDGEMENT C.A.V. On 07.07.2020 Delivered on 01/09/2020. 
 Heard learned counsel for the parties through V.C. 
 2. The instant application has been preferred by the original-petitioner-Rajesh Kumar Singh, for quashing and setting aside the order passed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police (Budget), Jharkhand, Ranchi communicated by letter No. 4095 dated 11.08.2009 (Annexure-19) whereby the departmental appeal preferred by the original-petitioner has been rejected. It has also been prayed for quashing of the Memo No. 93 dated 31.10.2008 (Annexur-16) and office order as contained in Memo No. 7352 dated 01.11.2008 (Annexure- 
 17) issued by the Superintendent of Police, (Vigilance) Bureau, Jharkhand, Ranchi, whereby the original-petitioner has been dismissed from service w.e.f. 31.10.2008.2 
 3. After the death of the original-petitioner the name of his widow and other legal heirs were substituted pursuant to the order dated 08.02.2017 passed in the instant case. 
 4. The instant case has a chequered history. The original- petitioner was appointed as Constable by office Order No. 23/90 dated 27.01.1990. After his appointment the original- petitioner was sent for Constable and Traffic Police Training at Traffic Training School, Jamshedpur. Thereafter, in the year, 1993, he was declared successful in departmental examination held in the year, 1993 and was also issued a certificate. After 12 years of his service, the original-petitioner was sent for PTC/ACP training in which also he was declared successful. 
 All of sudden, in the year, 1997 the Government of Bihar has taken a decision by Office Order as contained in Memo No. 140 dated 25.02.1997 to terminate the services of eight persons whose appointment was said to be illegal and accordingly, the then Superintendent of Police of the respective districts were directed to ensure that those eight persons are terminated. After creation of the State of Jharkhand, the Jharkhand Government vide Memo No.1389 dated 23.10.2003 also directed the concerned Superintendent of Police of different districts giving the names of nine persons saying that they have been illegally appointed by one Sri Vijay Pratap Singh, the then Inspector General of Police, just prior to his superannuation and as such, the appointment of those3nine persons are illegal and the respective Superintendent of Police were directed to ask for a show cause from them. 
 The original-petitioner being aggrieved by the said memo filed a writ application being W.P.(S) No. 5300 of 2003, which has been disposed of directing the respondent not to terminate the services of the original-petitioner in a routine manner and it has also been directed to take any action after giving proper show cause mentioning the reasons for the proposed termination. Thereafter, the original-petitioner was issued show-cause notice dated 14.11.2003 to which he replied. Thereafter, he was issued another show-cause notice dated 01.03.2004. Subsequently, the original-petitioner was once again issued show-cause notice as contained in Memo No. 1519/GS dated 22.09.2006 directing him to file a reply as to why his services be not terminated on the same set of charges i.e. his appointment is illegal as he was appointed by Sri Vijay Pratap Singh, who was not competent to appoint him. The original-petitioner filed its reply to show-cause on 01.10.2006, denying the allegations leveled against him stating therein that he was appointed in accordance with law and as per the provisions of Police Manual. However, the show-cause reply was not considered and the petitioner was terminated vide order as contained in Memo No. 1590 dated 09.10.2006 issued by the Inspector General of Police. Pursuant to that, the Superintendent of Police (Vigilance) Bureau issued a departmental order informing the original-4petitioner that he has been terminated w.e.f. 11.10.2006. 
 The original-petitioner immediately preferred an appeal against the order of termination dated 09.10.2006 before the appellate Authority and when no action was taken, he preferred writ application before this Court being W.P.(S) No. 371 of 2008, praying therein for quashing the order of termination. 
 The said writ application was disposed of vide order dated 03.03.2008, directing the Superintendent of Police (Vigilance), Ranchi to dispose of the appeal pending before him. Pursuant to the said order, the original-petitioner immediately filed representation before the Superintendent of Police (Vigilance) Jharkhand, Ranchi, but no action was taken in pursuance to the order dated 03.03.2008. Thereafter, the original-petitioner filed a contempt application being Cont. (Civil) Case No. 512 of 2008 before this Court for non- compliance of the order. However, during pendency of this contempt application, the original-petitioner received a letter of reinstatement as contained in Memo No. 1926 dated 27.09.2008. 
 Thereafter, the original-petitioner was issued a show- cause notice dated 29.09.2008 issued by the Superintendent of Police, Vigilance Bureau, Ranchi whereby, he was directed to submit his reply to the show-cause notice so that departmental proceeding could be initiated against him. He was also served with a charge-sheet as contained in Memo No.56937 dated 29.09.2008. In pursuance to the said show-cause notice and charge-sheet dated 29.09.2008, the original- petitioner immediately filed his detailed reply denying all allegations leveled against him. Thereafter, a departmental proceeding was conducted and the original-petitioner was terminated vide order as contained in Memo No. 93 dated 31.10.2008. 
 Thereafter, the original-petitioner filed a departmental appeal on 10.11.2008, and during pendency of the departmental appeal, the original-petitioner also filed a writ application being W.P.(S) No. 327 of 2009, however, the said writ application was dismissed as withdrawn by order dated 29.01.2009 passed by this Court. 
 5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the order of termination and order of appeal are totally arbitrary, mala-fide and without jurisdiction and as such, are liable to be set aside on the sole ground that it has been passed in most mechanical manner and without considering the points raised by the petitioner and the observations made by this Court. Learned counsel further contended that even the appellate authority in great haste did not consider the merits of the case and the points raised by the original-petitioner. She further contended that the appellate authority gravely erred in holding that the original-petitioner was not appointed in accordance with law on the ground that the Sargent Major was not the competent authority to take a decision with6regard to medical test. She finally concluded her argument by submitting that though the original-petitioner has filed several writ applications and during pendency of this writ application he expired and now his legal heirs including his widow is before this court, as such, their case may be considered sympathetically. 
 6. Per contra, learned counsel for the State submits that the instant application is fit to be dismissed because for the same set of reliefs, the original-petitioner had earlier filed a writ application before this Court and ultimately withdrew the same; as such, the petitioner is not entitled to raise the grounds which has already been raised and decided in the earlier case. He further contended that the original-petitioner- Rajesh Kumar Singh was appointed as constable by the then Inspector General of Police by violating the established rules of Police Manual and his termination is in accordance with Rules after following the due procedure as per the direction of this Court. He further submits that an illegal appointment cannot continue to sustain due to passage of time. 
 7. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and after going through the materials available on record, it transpires that the contention of the respondent-counsel that the instant writ application is hit by the principle of res judicata is not sustainable in the eyes of law because the order passed in W.P.(S) No. 327 of 2009 was dismissed as withdrawn and the case was not decided on merit. However, I am in agreement7with the other submissions of the learned counsel for the State that the appointment of the original-petitioner was not in accordance with law and the rules of Police Manual. There was no open advertisement and the original-petitioner was appointed by the Inspector General of Police, though, the appointing authority for constable is Superintendent of Police. An illegal appointment cannot be legalized by passage of time. In this regard reference may be made to the Judgment passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Orissa versus Mamata Mohanty reported in (2011) 3 SCC 436 where in para-37 & 38, the law has been laid down as under: 
 "" 37. It is a settled legal proposition that if an order is bad in its inception, it does not get sanctified at a later stage. A subsequent action/development cannot validate an action which was not lawful at its inception, for the reason that the illegality strikes at the root of the order. It would be beyond the competence of any authority to validate such an order. It would be ironic to permit a person to rely upon a law, in violation of which he has obtained the benefits. If an order at the initial stage is bad in law, then all further proceedings consequent thereto will be non est and have to be necessarily set aside. A right in law exists only and only when it has a lawful origin. (Vide Upen Chandra Gogoi v. State of Assam16,Mangal Prasad Tamoli v. Narvadeshwar Mishra17andRitesh Tewari v. State of U.P.18). 
 38. The concept of adverse possession of lien on post or holding over are not applicable in service jurisprudence. Therefore, continuation of a person wrongly appointed on post does not create any right in his favour. [Vide M.S. Patil (Dr.) v. Gulbarga University19.] Eligibility lacking"" 
 8. The issue is now no more res integra that if the original appointment was not made by following due process of selection as envisaged by the relevant rules, the appointment itself is illegal. Even the Director General of Police has no discretionary power to make any appointment on the post of8constable. There is nothing like absolute power vested in any authority to appoint any person. When the law provides procedure for appointment to a public post then the appointment is to be made by following the said procedure. 
 From the record it clearly transpires that there was no open advertisement and no due process of selection was followed as envisaged in the relevant Rules. It also transpires that the said Sri Vijay Pratap Singh made several appointments like the petitioner just on the verge on his retirement without having any power to appoint the constables and in complete violation of the relevant rules of the Police Manual. 
 9. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case and the discussions made hereinabove, the original- petitioner was not entitled for any relief as prayed for in the instant writ application; as a result, the instant writ application is dismissed.

 learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and Mr. Kaushik Sarkhel, learned counsel for the respondent State. 
 2. This writ petition has been heard through Video Conferencing in view of the guidelines of the High Court taking into account the situation arising due to COVID-19 pandemic. None of the parties have complained about any technical snag of audio-video and with their consent this matter has been heard. 
 3. Petitioner has preferred this writ petition for quashing the order dated 05.09.2019 contained in Annexure-4, whereby the service of the petitioner working on the post of Block Accounts Manager, Kashmar, Bokaro, has been terminated. 
 4. Mr. Prem Pujari Roy, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that an advertisement was issued by Jharkhand Rural Health Mission,2for filling of various post including the post of Block Accounts Manager. The petitioner applied for the same and being eligible, he was asked to participate in interview. The appointment letter was issued in favour of the petitioner vide letter dated 01.10.2008. By letter dated 15.10.2008 the petitioner has been posted at Primary Health Centre, Gomia Block. The primary work of the petitioner was to provide assistance in execution of accounts related to various health programs running at block level and further for execution of National Rural Health Mission, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, use of computer and other instruments. The petitioner joined on 18.10.2008 at Primary Health Centre, Gomia and petitioner was discharging his duty. The petitioner was rendering his service under the control of Civil Surgeon, Bokaro. Since the date of joining, the petitioner was rendering his continuous service since more than a decade. There has been certain irregularities and illegalities committed by the certain employees in National Health Rural Mission and thereby it has been alleged that a sum of Rs. 6,97,43,832.29/- has been misappropriated by them. For the aforesaid misappropriation, F.I.R. has been instituted against ten persons including the petitioner being Dhanbad P.S. Case No. 15 of 2019 dated 26.08.2019 for the offence undersections 109/120B/406/409/420/467/471/477I.P.C. and undersection 13(1)of the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018 and in view of the said allegation, the service of the petitioner has been terminated which was on contractual basis. 
 5. The case of the respondents is that the investigation was done by the Anti Corruption Bureau regarding several financial irregularities under National Health Mission in Dhanbad district. The information obtained during the said investigation about financial irregularities in the Community Health Centre, Jodhapokhar was published in Dainik Jagran newspaper. In the light of this, Managing Director, NHM was directed vide letter dated 11.03.2019, 10.07.20193and 01.08.2019 for immediate action against Shri Ajit Kumar, District Account Manager, Shri Pramod Kumar, Block Account Manager, Jodhapokhar, Shri Arun Kumar Singh, Block Account Manager, Primary Health Centre, Bhaghmara and Shri Ramjay Kumar Singh, who were involved in irregularities and misappropriation. The Anti Corruption Bureau, Ranchi lodged F.I.R against the petitioner and others for embezzlement of government money allotted under NRHM scheme at Primary Health Centre, Jharia-cum-Jodhapokhar, Dhanbad. Clarification was sought from the petitioner vide letter no. 838 (MD) dated 09.08.2019. Thereafter petitioner's contract was terminated vide letter dated 05.09.2019. 
 6. Mr. Prem Pujari Roy, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that without any appropriate proceeding, the petitioner's service has been brought to an end and in view of violation of principles of natural justice, impugned order is fit to be quashed. He further submitted that it was incumbent upon the respondents to await the outcome of criminal case initiated against the petitioner but without awaiting, dismissal order has been passed. 
 7. Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon judgment of this Court passed in L.P.A. No. 692 of 2005 dated 17.07.2006. He has relied upon judgment in the case of ""Raj Kumar Singh Vs. Ranchi Regional Development Authority and Ors"" reported in (2008) 1 JCR 265 (Jhr). 
 8. Mr. Kaushik Sarkhel, learned counsel for the respondent-State submitted that the petitioner was contractual employee. He has no right to continue in service. He further submitted that opportunity of show-cause has been provided to the petitioner. Referring to letter dated 05.09.2019 contained in Annexure-C to the counter-affidavit, he submitted that show-cause was asked from the petitioner but the petitioner has chosen not to reply show-cause. 
 9. The Court has perused Annexure-C which is letter dated 05.09.20194whereby it transpires that show-cause was asked from the petitioner but the petitioner has chosen not to reply. A criminal case is pending against the petitioner and others for mis-appropriation of huge amount in the light of Anti Corruption Bureau investigation. Petitioner's service is not governed by any statutory Rule. Petitioner has not been appointed on regular basis. The service of the petitioner is governed in terms of agreement on the basis of the same petitioner has been employed. Reference in this regard may be made to the case of ""State of Madhya Pradesh Vs. Sandhya Tomar"" reported in (2013) 11 SCC 357 in which the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under:- 
 ""9. There can be no dispute with respect to the settled legal proposition that in the event that a person is not appointed on a regular basis, and if his service is not governed by any statutory rules, he shall be bound by the terms and conditions that have been incorporated in his appointment letter. (Vide State of Punjab Vs. Surinder Kumar. In such an eventually, there can be no reason with respect to why the terms and conditions incorporated in the appointment letter should not be enforced against such an employee. In the instant case, Respondent 1 was temporarily appointed in a project and thus, she had at no point of time, been appointed on a regular basis, owing to which she cannot claim any lien with respect to the said post."" 
 10. So far as the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner in L.P.A. No. 692 of 2005 is concerned, this is not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the case as in that caseArticle 311of the Constitution of India was considered and the service of the employee was governed by certain provisions. So far as the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner in Raj Kumar Singh (supra) case is concerned, is also not applicable in the facts and circumstances of this case as in that case where the petitioner was terminated without notice and the petitioner was not facing any criminal trial whereas, in the present case the petitioner is facing a criminal case of5misappropriation of huge amount. Law is well-settled that contractual employee has no right to continue in service in absence of any statutory provision, thus the said judgment is not helping the petitioner. 
 11. It is well-settled proposition of law that casual employee engaged on daily wages basis, on termination of his service, claiming right to continue in service and temporary status covered by theIndustrial Disputes Actand remedy lies before the Tribunal or before the Labour Court and not before the High Court. Admitted position is that the petitioner has been appointed on contractual basis for that agreement has been entered into. 
 12. In view of cumulative effect of the above discussions, there is no merit in the writ petition. Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed.

 02/1-9-2020 Heard the parties. 
 Defect No. 9 (vi) and (vii), as pointed out by the office, are ignored. 
 The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Basal P.S. Case No. 17 of 2013, G.R. No. 3434 of 2013. 
 It has been alleged that for the implementation of various schemes under Backward Region Grant Fund, advance was taken by Sunil Kumar, the then Assistant Engineer posted in the Rural Development Special Division, Hazaribagh. On physical verification of the work assigned to Sunil Kumar, it is alleged that there was a difference of Rs.24,65,650/- between the advance taken by said Sunil Kumar and the work done. The F.I.R. was instituted for recovery of Rs.64,120/- with regard to ten BRGF Projects of Patratu Block under Basal P.S. Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the main accused Sunil Kumar has been granted anticipatory bail by this Court in A.B.A. No. 1386 of 2016 on deposit of the amount of Rs.64,120/-. He has further stated that the petitioner was the Executive Engineer at the relevant point of time and infact he has not been named in the F.I.R. It has further been stated that the F.I.R. was instituted after a considerable delay from the date the project was said to have been completed. 
 Learned A.P.P. has opposed the prayer for anticipatory bail of the petitioner. 
 It appears from the F.I.R that the allegations are centered around Sunil Kumar, who as stated above, has already been granted anticipatory bail by this Court albeit on the condition of deposit of Rs.64,120/-. which was the shortfall detected. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. 
 The petitioner, named above, is accordingly directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, he will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- ( Ten thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ramgarh in connection with Basal P.S.

 In view of the aforesaid submission, this Criminal Misc. Petition stands abated.

He further submits that all the prosecution witnesses have been examined in this case. He also submits that he is ready to conclude the argument virtually also before the court below.

 The petitioner is an accused for the offence punishable under Section(s) 302, 120B and 34of the Indian Penal Code,Section 27of the Arms Act. 
 The petitioner has renewed his prayer for bail on the ground that he is in custody since 15.7.2017. Counsel for the petitioner submits that at least four witnesses are yet to be examined and no one has seen the petitioner committing the murder of the deceased. He also submits that the witnesses are not being examined now due to Covid19. 
 Learned A.P.P opposes the prayer for bail of the petitioner, but has not controverted the aforesaid submission. 
 Since no one has seen the petitioner committing the murder of the deceased and the fact that the witnesses are not being examined now, I am inclined to release the petitioner on bail.

 -------- 
 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel appearing for the State assisted by the learned counsel for the O.P. No. 2. 
 So far as the defect nos. 5(a) and 5(e) are concerned, learned counsel for the petitioner undertakes to remove the same once the situation normalizes. As regards defect nos. 9(i) to 9(x) are concerned, the same are ignored. 
 The petitioners apprehend their arrest in connection with C/1 Case No. 1892 of 2019, registered for the offences punishable under sections 323, 498 A, 504of the Indian Penal Code. 
 The marriage of the complainant was solemnized with the petitioner on 19.06.2018. It has been alleged that in the first night the complainant discovered that the petitioner is impotent. It has further been alleged there was a demand of a car and on nonfulfillment of the said demand as well as the disclosure of the impotency of the petitioner the complainant was subjected to torture. On 21.06.2019 the petitioner had left for Dubai and on 22.06.2019, the complainant was ousted from her matrimonial house. 
 Learned counsel for the O.P. No. 2 has stated that the complaint petition is replete with allegations of assault and torture committed upon the complainant. It has been stated that the impotency of the petitioner was suppressed but subsequently in the first night itself when the said fact came to the knowledge to the complainant she was threatened with dire consequences by the petitioner if the said fact was disclosed by the complainant. 
 It appears from the complaint petition that the allegations are general and omnibus in nature so far as the present petitioner is concerned with respect to the demand of a car and the subsequent torture committed upon the complainant. The grievance of the complainant primarily stems from the purported impotency of the petitioner which, however, has been vehemently denied by the petitioner. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. Accordingly, the petitioner, above named, is directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, he will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st class, Jamshedpur connection with C/1 Case No. 1892 of 2019, subject to the conditions as laid down undersection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

 1. Heard Mr. Atanu Banerjee, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner. 
 2. Heard Ms. Mahua Palit, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite-party. 
 3. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that mainly two points are involved in this case. Firstly, the petitioner has been convicted underSection 417of Indian Penal Code, although the petitioner was charged underSections 376/316of IPC and accordingly, the gist of acquisition for offence underSections 415/417of IPC was never explained to the petitioner. He submits that this aspect of the matter goes to the root of the case and in absence of explaining the gist of acquisition to the petitioner underSections 415/417of IPC, the petitioner could not have been convicted under the said section. 
 4. Further argument of the petitioner is that by the impugned order a fine amount of Rs. 5,000/- has been imposed by recording that the petitioner was earning, but he has stated in para-5 of the memo of revision that the petitioner was remanded in custody on 23.10.2002 and he was under detention till the date of the judgment i.e. on 23.09.2004 and as such the petitioner could not have been said to be an earning person. 
 5. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that in this view of the matter, the punishment, so far as it relates to imposition of fine, is perverse and is fit to be set-aside. The2learned counsel further submits that so far as the other part of the punishment is concerned, the same has already been served by the petitioner as has been recorded by the learned lower appellate court. He refers to section 15 of Juvenile Justice Act. 
 6. The learned counsel also refers to Section 19 of the Juvenile Justice Act to submit that an observation may be made that the petitioner will not be disqualified in future pursuant to the impugned judgement. The learned counsel has also referred toSection 222of Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 7. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party, on the other hand, vehemently opposes the prayer and submits that the Juvenile Justice Board as well as the learned lower appellate court have scrutinized the evidences on record and in fact a case underSection 376of IPC was made out, but still the Juvenile Justice Board has convicted the petitioner only underSection 417of IPC. She submits that there is no illegality or perversity in the impugned judgements and the petitioner does not deserve any sympathetic view of this court. However, she does not dispute that the judgment passed by the Juvenile Justice Board was never challenged by the State or by the victim. 
 8. Hearing is concluded. 
 9. Post this case on 14.09.2020 for judgment.

 It has been alleged that there was a demand of Rs. 1,50,000/- and on non-fulfillment of which she was subjected to torture. The accused persons are also alleged to have caused her miscarriage and ultimately the informant was ousted from her matrimonial house.

 A truck loaded with liquor was intercepted and the papers produced were prima facie found to be forged. 
 The petitioner appears to be the owner of the vehicle and learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the son of the petitioner who was the driver of the vehicle and who was apprehended at the spot was involved in liquor business but the petitioner does not have any concern with the same. It has further been stated that the vehicle was entrusted to his son and in such circumstances the petitioner can in no way be held responsible for any offence which has been committed. Learned counsel further submits that the documents were produced but the same has never been verified to ascertain regarding the genuineness of the said document and only on the basis of a prima facie finding that the documents are forged the entire liquor were seized and the driver was apprehended. 
 Learned A.P.P. has opposed the prayer for anticipatory bail of the petitioner.

 Learned counsel for the appellant submits that though the impugned judgment was passed on 27.04.2007 but because of the administrative delay which was due to the failure of the advocate of the Railways in the High Court to disclose the position and status of the case, there was a delay in filing the appeal but subsequently because of the mistaken legal advice instead of filing the appeal, the appellant filed W.P.(C) No.359 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.371 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.870 of 2015 ,W.P.(C) No.871 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.872 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.873 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.874 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.875 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.1350 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.1354 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.1355 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.1356 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.1357 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.1358 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.2101 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.2106 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.2107 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.2137 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.2147 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.2151 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.2213 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.2226 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.2227 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.2243 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.2244 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.2245 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.2309 of 2015, W.P.(C) No.2310 of 2015 and W.P.(C) No.2318 of 2015 before a co-ordinate Bench of this Court and the co-ordinate Bench of this Court held that the writ applications are not maintainable and dismissed the writ applications with a liberty to the appellants to avail the statutory remedy underSection 54of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, in accordance with law. It is submitted that the delay thus caused in filing the appeal is due to non-supply of the relevant documents for filing the case and were beyond the control of the appellant.

 Mr. Suraj Kumar- learned counsel appearing for the contesting respondents submits that the respondents have serious objection to the prayer for condonation of delay but keeping in view the fact that the respondents could not succeed in realizing the compensation amount, the respondents have no objection if the instant interlocutory application for condoning the delay of 3200 days is allowed with the condition that the appellant will deposit the compensation amount awarded by the impugned judgment, before the court below within eight weeks from the date of this order. 
 Considering the facts and circumstances of the case as well as the undertaking given on behalf of the appellant, the delay of 3200 days in filing the instant appeal is condoned subject to the condition that the appellant will deposit the entire compensation amount awarded by the impugned judgment before the court below within eight weeks from the date of this order. 
 It is made clear that in case of failure of the appellant to deposit the entire compensation amount awarded by the impugned judgment before the court below within eight weeks from the date of this order, the conditional order shall not be given effect to and the instant interlocutory application and consequently this appeal shall stand dismissed being barred by limitation without further reference to the Bench.

 02/1-9-2020 Heard the parties. 
 Defects, as pointed out by the office, are ignored. The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Sadar Chatra P.S. Case No. 184 of 2015, G.R. No. 948 of 2015. 
 It has been alleged that under the MANREGA, in certain schemes, the sanctioned amount was withdrawn without completing the work. 
 The petitioner was the Junior Engineer at the relevant point of time. The defalcated amount is to the tune of Rs.2,74,522/-. One of the Junior Engineers namely Kedar Prasad Singh has been granted anticipatory bail by this Court in A.B.A. No. 4845 of 2019 subject to the deposit of Rs. 2,74,522/-. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner on being questioned has not been able to state as to whether the said amount has been deposited by the accused Kedar Prasad Singh or not. 
 In such circumstances, therefore, since the co-accused has been granted anticipatory bail by this Court in A.B.A. No. 4845 of 2019 albeit on certain conditions as indicated above, I am inclined to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioner subject to the condition that the co-accused Kedar Prasad Singh has already deposited an amount of Rs.2,74,522/- as indicated in the order passed in A.B.A. No.4845 of 2019. 
 If the directions passed in A.B.A. No.4845 of 2019 has been followed and the amount in question in the said order has already been deposited by Kedar Prasad Singh, the petitioner, named above, in such event, shall surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, he will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- ( Ten thousand only) with two-2-sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Chatra, in connection with Sadar Chatra P.S.

 ------ 
 03/01.09.2020 The petitioner has prayed for bail. As per the counsel for the petitioner In this case petitioner is facing trial wherein charge has been framed underSection 307,328,323,341IPC on 16.2.2019. He submits that the Victim has been examined in this case in part and in her examination she has stated nothing about administering of poison to her.Counsel for the petitioner has brought on record the deposition of P.W. 3, Nitu Devi, who is the victim of this case. I have perused the same. 
 On 24.02.2020 the victim was examined as P.W. 3. Only one paragraph of the examination in chief was recorded by the court below thereafter in the second paragraph the Principal Sessions Judge, Giridih has mentioned that there is chance of settlement as such the examination is differed. 
 This court fails to understand as to how the Principal District and Sessions Judge, Giridih, has deferred the examination of victim and adjourned the case holding that there is a chance of settlement, where accused are facing trial and the offences are not compoundable. The recording of the second paragraph prima facie suggests that court on his own motion has adjourned the case. The offences are not compoundable. Suo moto adjourning the case in the midst of recording evidence by the court in the manner it has been done is not proper. This type of adjournment with the ground mentioned in paragraph 2 of the deposition encourages tampering with the evidence. No court can be a party to it. 
 Before proceeding any further , I direct the Sessions Judge, Giridih to submit an explanation under what circumstances he adjourned the recording of evidence of the victim and on what material he recorded the finding that there is a chance of settlement when the offences are not compoundable. 
 Let a copy of this order be communicated through FAX to the Principal Sessions Judge, Giridih immediately so that reply may reach this Court within three weeks from today. 
 List this case after three weeks before this Court for passing further orders.

 It has been alleged that the accused persons had assaulted the informant with bricks and stones. It has further been alleged that Bishwajit Ravidas had given a sword blow which was defended by the informant with his hand. 
 It appears that two persons had sustained injuries and the specific allegation of assault seems to have been attributed to Bishwajit Ravidas. So far as the petitioners are concerned they all are ladies and the allegations are general and omnibus in nature. 
 Regard being had to the aforesaid facts, the petitioners, named above, are directed to surrender before the learned court below within a period of four weeks and on such surrender, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bermo at Tenughat, Dist-Bokaro in connection with I.E.L.

 Defect no. 8 as pointed out by the office is ignored. The petitioner has prayed for grant of anticipatory bail, as he is apprehending his arrest in connection with Korrah P.S. Case No. 74/2018. 
 The informant was assaulted by the petitioner and others. It has been alleged that the SIM of the mobile was taken out by the accused. The reason for the occurrence is of non-returning of an amount of Rs. 6,00,000/- by co-accused Deepak Kumar which had been taken with respect to transaction of a piece of land. 
 It appears that the main accused Deepak Kumar has been granted anticipatory bail by this Court in A.B.A. No. 6546 of 2019. The petitioner does not have any criminal antecedent as has been stated in this application. 
 Regard being had to the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petitioner accordingly is directed to surrender before the learned court below within a period of four weeks and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned A.C.J.M., Hazaribag in connection with Korrah P.S.

 Defects as pointed out by the office are ignored. The petitioners have prayed for grant of anticipatory bail, as they are apprehending their arrest in connection with Godda (Muffasil) P.S. Case No. 191/2019. 
 It has been alleged that the petitioners had entered into the house of the informant and had started assaulting the informant. On account of the said assault she had sustained grievous injuries. 
 So far as the petitioner no. 2 is concerned it appears that she had assaulted on the head of the informant with rod and the injury found on the head of the informant corroborates the allegation levelled against the petitioner no. 2. The reason for the occurrence appears to be the fact that the husband of the informant had given 2500 bricks as loan to the accused and when it was demanded back the assault had taken place. 
 In view of the specific nature of allegation against the petitioner no. 2, I am not inclined to grant anticipatory bail to her. Her prayer for bail is hereby rejected.

 Order No. 03: Dated: 1 September, 2020 st Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel appearing for the State. 
 So far as defect no. 9(i) is concern, the same is ignored. The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Katkamdag P.S. Case No. 37 of 2019, registered for the offences punishable undersections 379,420,120Bof the Indian Penal Code. 
 It has been alleged that one Prakash Nayak, the weighment operator, had made entry of two HYVA vehicles without their physical presence as well as without physical verification. The fraud was committed with the connivance of the transporters, owners and the drivers of the vehicles. 
 The petitioner appears to be the defacto owner of the truck bearing registration no. JH 02V 9156 having taken the same from Amrit Mahto on agreement. The suspicion upon the petitioner is on account of the facts noted above. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner does not have any criminal antecedent. 
 Regard being had to the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. Accordingly, the petitioner, above named, is directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, he will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned S.D.J.M., Hazaribag, in connection with Katkamdag P.S.

 Order No. 03 Dated 1st September, 2020 Heard the learned counsel for the respective sides. Defect No.9 (iv), as pointed out by the office, is ignored. The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Maheshpur P.S. Case No.146 of 2019, Special POCSO No.25 of 2019. 
 The petitioner was suspected to have enticed away the daughter of the informant. 
 Although, learned Sr. counsel for the petitioner has stated about the various discrepancies which have appeared in the First Information Report as well as the 164Cr.P.C. statement of the victim but it appears that in the 164Cr.P.C. statement of the victim, she has categorically stated that it was the petitioner and one Prasenjit who had forcibly taken her away on a motorcycle and she was thereafter, subjected to rape. 
 In view of the specific nature of allegations levelled against the petitioner, I am not inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. This application is accordingly rejected. 
 Learned Sr. counsel for the petitioner, at this juncture, submits that one of the co-accused has been granted regular bail by this Court. He further submits that the petitioner shall surrender before the learned court below within a period of three weeks. 
 If the petitioner surrenders before the learned court below within the aforesaid period and prays for bail, the learned court below shall endeavor to dispose of the bail application expeditiously and shall also take into consideration that one of the co-accused has been granted bail by this Court.

 A dilapidated house was raided and flesh of bovine animals were recovered. It has been alleged that one Sahzada was apprehended who disclosed about the other accused persons who had kept the flesh for the purposes of sale.

 It is regretted that even the office has not raised this issue of maintainability at any point of time.

 Learned A.P.P. opposes the prayer for bail. The petitioner is an accused for allegedly committing an offence punishable underSections 4of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act andSection 376IPC. 
 Counsel for the petitioner submits that petitioner is in custody for nearly two years. He submits that evidence has not yet been concluded. Even after giving much opportunity to the prosecution i.e one year, the prosecution failed to produce the victim as a witness. 
 Considering the aforesaid submission and the latches on part of the prosecution, I am inclined to allow this application. Accordingly, the petitioner above named is directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, Seraikella in connection with RIT P.S.

 2. This Cr.M.P. has been filed invoking the jurisdiction of this Court underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure with a prayer to quash the order dated 26.11.2009 passed by learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Ranchi whereby and where under learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Ranchi has found prima facie case for the offences punishable underSections 423,424,467,468,469,471,477A,409,201,109and120-Bof the Indian Penal Code andSection 13(1) (d) read with 13 (2) of thePrevention of Corruption Act, 1988 against the petitioner and the co-accused persons of the case and accordingly took cognizance against the petitioner as well as the entire criminal proceeding in connection with Special Case No.15 of 2000 arising out of Vigilance P.S. Case No.28 of 2000. 
 3. The brief facts of this case is that one Tulsidas Kanodia sold 11 kathas of land pertaining to plot No.28 falling within the urban area of Ranchi on 01.07.1982 to the vendor of the petitioner namely Vir Kumar Jain. Since the proceeding under the Urban Land (Ceiling and1Cr. M.P. No.2329 of 2014Regulation) Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') was going on, hence, the vendor of the petitioner filed an application before the competent authority for dropping the proceeding as far as the 11 kathas of the land is concerned but the application was rejected on 06.07.1987 by holding that the deed of transfer is null and void. In spite of that, the vendor of the petitioner sold the land to the petitioner and another person on 12.06.1989 concealing the fact that his prayer for dropping of the proceeding with respect to that land had already been rejected by the competent authority. In spite of that, the land was mutated in the name of the petitioner in violation of the provision as contained inSection 5(3)of the Act. It is alleged that the petitioner in criminal conspiracy with the co-accused persons including the Revenue Officers and the Officers of the concerned Government department abetted the commission of the said act. 
 4. After completion of the investigation charge-sheet has been submitted and by the impugned order cognizance of the said offences has been taken inter alia against the petitioner. 
 5. Mrs. J. Mazumdar- learned counsel for the petitioner submits that even accepting that the entire allegations against the petitioner are true, what the petitioner is alleged to have done is that in spite of the application filed for dropping out 11 kathas of the land from the Land Ceiling being rejected, the petitioner was instrumental in the said land getting transferred to his name and got the said transferred land mutated in his name. It is next submitted that at best the transfer which was made in the name of the petitioner on 12.06.1989 may be null and void but certainly the petitioner cannot be prosecuted for any criminal offence of forgery,2Cr. M.P. No.2329 of 2014 criminal breach of trust, fraudulent execution of deed of transfer or dishonest or fraudulent removal or concealment of property. It is next submitted that the essential ingredients to constitute the offence punishable underSection 13(1) (d) ofPrevention of Corruption Act, 1988 is lacking and the fact that the petitioner came into picture after a period of about 7 years from the original purchase of the land by the vendor from the person in possession of the land in excess of the land prescribed under the Act namely Tulsidas Kanodia. It is then submitted that, it cannot be said that the criminal conspiracy was going on for a period of more than seven years in which the petitioner was allegedly involved. It is also submitted that the cognizance taken against the co- accused persons namely Vir Kumar Jain has been quashed vide order dated 07.11.2012 in Cr.M.P.

Mazumdar that the impugned order dated 26.11.2009 passed by learned Special Judge,3Cr. M.P. No.2329 of 2014 Vigilance, Ranchi by which cognizance has been taken for the said offences so far as it relates to this petitioner, be quashed. 
 6. Mr. Suraj Verma- learned counsel for the Vigilance on the other hand submits that the petitioner has purchased and got mutated 11 kathas of land of Tulsidas Kanodia though the competent authority for dropping out the said 11 kathas of land, which was purchased by the vendor of the petitioner, has dismissed the said proceeding and the vendor of the petitioner as well as the petitioner without bringing the fact to the notice of the competent authority for registration of the sale deed and mutation of the said land in favour of this petitioner, has got the same mutated in the name of the petitioner in conspiracy with the co-accused persons. It is next submitted by Mr. Verma that at the stage of cognizance and summoning, the Magistrate is required to apply his mind only with the view to take cognizance of the offence and at the time of taking cognizance, the Magistrate is not required to evaluate the merits of the material. In support of this contention, Mr. Verma relies upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Sonu Gupta Vs. Deepak Gupta & Others reported in (2015) 3 SCC 424 para-8 of which reads as under:- 
 8. ""Having considered the details of allegations made in the complaint petition, the statement of the complainant on solemn affirmation as well as materials on which the appellant placed reliance which were called for by the learned Magistrate, the learned Magistrate, in our considered opinion, committed no error in summoning the accused persons. At the stage of cognizance and summoning the Magistrate is required to apply his judicial mind only with a view to take cognizance of the offence, or, in other words, to find out whether prima facie case has been made out for summoning the accused persons. At this stage, the learned Magistrate is not required to consider the defence version or materials or arguments nor is he required to evaluate the merits of the materials or evidence of the4Cr. M.P. No.2329 of 2014 complainant, because the Magistrate must not undertake the exercise to find out at this stage whether the materials will lead to conviction or not.""(Emphasis supplied) Hence, it is submitted that there is ample material in the record to take cognizance against the petitioner and as the learned court below having rightly taken the cognizance against the petitioner, this Cr.M.P. being without any merit be dismissed. 
 7. Having heard the submissions made at the Bar and after carefully going through the evidence in the record, it appears that the vendor of the petitioner having purchased 11 kathas of land from Tulsidas Kanodia on 01.07.1982 filed an application before the competent authority in a proceeding which has been initiated against the original land holder for dropping out of the proceeding for 11 kathas of land. The application got dismissed. In spite of that the vendor of the petitioner sold the land to the petitioner and another purchaser on 12.06.1989 by separate registered sale-deed. There is no material in the record to suggest that the petitioner had any knowledge about the said misdeeds of his vendor but only because he purchased the land from the co- accused vendor namely Veer Kumar Jain, hence, he has been implicated in this case for having been in criminal conspiracy with the co-accused public servant officers and staffs of the revenue department as well as the original land holder Tulsidas Kanodia and his vendor committed the offences alleged. UnderSection 10of the Act if one transfers the land which was the subject matter of the proceeding after the notification is issued underSection 10(3) of the said Act, the transfer would be deemed to be null and void. At the same time, the Act also prescribe that if one who is holding land excess than ceiling limit transfer of such land becomes null and void. 
 Cr. M.P. No.2329 of 2014 TheSection 464of the Indian Penal Code divides false documents into three categories:- 
 (i) Firstly where a person dishonestly or fraudulently makes or executes a document with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document was made or executed by some other person, or by the authority of some other person, by whom or by whose authority he knows it was not made or executed. 
 (ii) Secondly where a person dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation or otherwise, alters a document in any material part, without lawful authority, after it has been made or executed by either himself or any other person. 
 (iii) Thirdly where a person dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, execute or alter a document knowing that such person could not by reason of 
 (a) unsoundness of mind; 
 (b) intoxication; or 
 (c) deception practiced upon him, know the contents of the document or the nature of alteration. In other words, a person is said to have made a ""false document"", if 
 (i) he makes or executes a document claiming to be someone else or authorized by someone else; or 
 (ii) he alters or tampers a document; or 
 (iii) he obtains a document by practicing deception, or from a person not in control of his senses. So even if the land transferred to the name of the petitioner by an erroneous or illegal order passed by a public servant being against the statute, the same does not constitute any offence punishable underSections 467,468,469,471and477or 477Aof the Indian Penal Codeas passing of an illegal order does not assume any characteristics of making a false document. At the same time, the allegations against the petitioner do not6Cr. M.P. No.2329 of 2014 constitute the offence punishable underSection 409is not made out as there is no allegation of entrustment of any property to any Public Servant. Similarly, the offences punishable underSections 423or 424of the Indian Penal Codeis not made out as there is no allegation to suggest that the petitioner was having the knowledge of the fact that the said application to drop the said 11 katha of land was dismissed. Thus the essential ingredients of 'Fraudulently' as defined insection 26of the Indian Penal Code that the petitioner does the alleged acts with intent to defraud is not made out from the allegations made. 
 8. So far as the offence punishable underSection 13(2)read withSection 13(1)(d)of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 is concerned, though it is alleged that the petitioner in criminal conspiracy got transferred the land to his name in spite of the prayer of his vendor for dropping of the proceedings from the land purchased being rejected and being contrary to the provision of the statute but there is no allegation that the said act has been done by adopting corrupt practices or illegal means for having pecuniary advantage/valuable thing for himself or for any other person. In the absence of the said essential ingredients to constitute the offences punishable underSection 13(1) (d) of thePrevention of Corruption Act, 1988, the petitioner cannot be prosecuted underSection 13(1) (d) read withSection 13(2) of thePrevention of Corruption Act, 1988. 
 Thus, this Court is of the considered view that the instant case falls within the category (1) and (3) which reads as under : 
 (1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused. 
 Cr. M.P. No.2329 of 2014 (3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused. 
 enunciated in the illustrative lists of the cases where the cognizance can be quashed either in exercise of the jurisdiction underArticle 226of the Constitution of India or the inherent power underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure to prevent the abuse of the process of Court in the case of State of Haryana & Others Vs. Bhajan Lal [1992 Supp (1) SCC 335]. Hence, it will be gross abuse of the process of law if the criminal proceeding is allowed to continue against the petitioner and the petitioner is asked to face rigor of criminal trial when the allegations made against him in the first information report and the charge-sheet even if are taken at their face value and are accepted to be true do not constitute any offence against the petitioner. 
 9. Accordingly, the entire criminal proceeding of Special Case No.15 of 2000 arising out of Vigilance P.S. Case No.28 of 2000 registered underSections 423,424,467,468,469,471,477A,409,201,109and120-Bof the Indian Penal Code andSection 13(1) (d) read with 13 (2) of thePrevention of Corruption Act, 1988 including the order taking cognizance, so far as it relates to petitioner, is quashed and set aside. 
 10. In the result, this application is allowed.

 1. Petitioners, through this criminal miscellaneous petition have prayed for quashing the entire criminal proceeding, the FIR and the order dated 22.12.2018 passed in Complaint Case No.1409 of 2018, whereby the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate sent a copy of complaint petition to the Officer-in-Charge underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with a direction to register a First Information Report and submit a report after investigation. 
 2. This case was listed under the heading ""For Orders"". Counsel for the parties in course of arguments, submitted that this criminal miscellaneous petition can be disposed of at the stage of 'Orders' itself, so they finally argued at length. After hearing the parties, the final order was reserved, which is being delivered today. 
 3. The present case arises out of complaint case being Complaint Case No.1409 of 2018. The opposite party No.2 had initially filed Sanha on 22.11.2018 and thereafter had filed the complaint in the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bokaro. The complainant earlier lodged an FIR being Sector P.S. Case No.86 of 2018 against Mr. Uni Krishnan, MD, Thermax Ltd. alleging fraudulent business transaction. It is alleged that the petitioners, claiming themselves as Officers of Thermax Ltd., contacted the complainant on 14.08.2018 through his mobile phone 9934123755 for amicable solution of the aforesaid case. The complainant had at first refused to the proposal of2meeting, but, later on agreed to meet the accused persons on 15.08.2018 at Hans Regency. The complainant along with Mr. Kamal Kishore Prasad and Dilip Kumar Singh, who was his staff went to the said Hotel at Room No.412 to meet the petitioners. It is alleged that the amicable communication turned into squabbled. Petitioner No.1 started creating compulsion on the complainant to withdraw the said case. It is alleged that if he will settle on their terms and conditions, then the complainant will be compensated by an amount of Rs.10,00,000/-. It is alleged that the complainant was not willing to bow down to the rash behaviour and mischievous intentions. Seeing such contrary opinion of the complainant, it is alleged that the petitioner No.1 dishonestly induced the complainant that he can turn the table and bring change in scenario for which the complainant will have to pay Rs.20,00,000/-. It is alleged that the petitioners put the complainant in fear of his death and that of his family members if he resists from either to withdraw Sector 4 P.S. Case No.86 of 2018 or pay them the amount of Rs.20,00,000/-. It is alleged that the complainant was also physically assaulted by the petitioners in the Hotel Room, but due to intervention by Kamal Kishore Prasad, the complainant came out of the hotel room and was very ill due to such unexpected event. Due to his deteriorating health, he was taken to America for treatment on 23.09.2018. It is alleged that on 24.10.2018, when the complainant came back to India, he started receiving extortion calls from unknown numbers for Rs.20,00,000/-, whereafter he registered a Sanha in Sector 1 Police Station on 22.11.2018. It is alleged on 17.12.2018, one more letter was given to the Officer-in-Charge, Sector 1 Police Station as reminder, but FIR was not registered by the police against the petitioners due to their influence and approaches. It is alleged that the complainant is still living in great fear and apprehension that the petitioners may commit murder of the complainant and his family members. 
 4. Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioners, challenging the First Information Report, submits that no offence at all far less a criminal offence is made out from a bare perusal of the First Information Report. He submits that a complaint was filed in utter violation of the provisionsof the Codeof Criminal Procedure and the complaint was referred underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure for registering a First Information Report. He submits that there was no application of mind in sending the complaint to the police under the provisions ofSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He submits that the order dated322.12.2018, by which the complaint was sent underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure to the B.S. City Police for registering a First Information Report is not only cryptic, but, it is absolutely a non-speaking one. He further submits that if the complaint petition is seen (certified copy of the same has been filed), nowhere one could find any affidavit in terms ofSection 154of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He submits that since there is a violation and non-compliance ofSection 154(1)and154(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the entire First Information Report is liable to be quashed. He submits that the meeting, which had taken between the parties, was to resolve a dispute, which is commercial in nature for which earlier Police Station Case No.86 of 2018 was registered. He submits that it would be evident from the complaint petition that an offer was made to pay Rs.10,00,000/- by way of compensation / amicable solution and a submission was put forth in turn to withdraw the criminal case. This fact of negotiation cannot be said to be an extortion and also by no stretch of imagination can be said to be a threat. He submits that there is nothing on record to suggest that the accused persons had put the complainant in fear of death to extort Rs.20,00,000/-. By referring to paragraph 11 of the complaint, it is submitted that there is no element of extortion, as it was merely an offer either to withdraw Sector IV Police Station Case No.86 of 2018 or to pay them the amount of Rs.20,00,000/- for settling the dispute. He submits that this cannot be said to be extortion by any means. Reference of incidence of 24.08.2018, which is at paragraph 15, clearly suggests that the amount of Rs.20,00,000/- was demanded for settling the dispute and nothing more. Lastly, it was submitted that since no offence is made out, First Information Report is liable to be quashed. 
 5. Mr. Rajendra Krishna, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party No.2 submits that from perusal of paragraphs 11 to 16 and 17 of the Complaint petition, a cognizable offence is definitely made out, thus, the Court was well within its jurisdiction to send the same for registering a First Information Report. He submits that since an offence is made out, the First Information Report cannot be quashed. He further submits that definitely the complainant was given threat and the petitioners demanded money, which clearly suggests that there was a threat of extortion. According to him, since an offence is made out the First Information Report cannot be quashed. It is also the case of the complainant that he received emails wherein money was4demanded for settling the dispute and some sarcastic comments were made from which he felt threatened. 
 6. A complaint was filed, which was sent underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure for registering a First Information Report. While I go through the complaint, I find that the said complaint is not accompanied by any affidavit.Section 154(1)of the Code of Criminal Procedure andSection 154(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure are very important in this respect. As per the aforesaid sectionsof the Codeof Criminal Procedure, every information relating to commission of cognizable offence has to be given orally or in writing to the Officer-in-Charge and the substance of such information shall be entered in the book kept in the office. This means a First Information Report has been lodged when the police received an information about cognizable offence. If there is a refusal to register a First Information Report, then the remedy lies inSection 154(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure, wherein the aggrieved person may send the substance of such information in writing by post to the Superintendent of Police, who can investigate or direct an investigation, if according to him, a cognizable offence is made out. In this case, I find that nothing has been mentioned in the complaint, as to whether this provision ofSection 154(1)orSection 154(3)was invoked. Rather, the counsel for the opposite party No.2 could not satisfy the Court on this question and also there is no whisper in the complaint petition about the same. Without exhausting the mandatory provisions, the complaint was filed, which was sent underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 7. Remedy available underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not routine in nature. It requires application of mind and a speaking order to be passed. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Priyanka Srivastava & Another versus the State of Uttar Pradesh & Others reported in (2015) 6 SCC 287, has dealt with this issue extensively. In the aforesaid judgment, the Hon'ble Court highlighted the importance ofSection 154(1)andSection 154(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure and has also dealt with the mis-use of the powers underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In paragraph 30 and 31 of the aforesaid judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in detail, has held as to how the Court has to deal in this situation. Paragraphs 30 and 31 of the said judgment reads as under: - 
 30. In our considered opinion, a stage has come in this country whereSection 156(3)CrPC applications are to be supported by an affidavit duly sworn by the applicant who seeks the invocation of the jurisdiction of the5Magistrate. That apart, in an appropriate case, the learned Magistrate would be well advised to verify the truth and also can verify the veracity of the allegations. This affidavit can make the applicant more responsible. We are compelled to say so as such kind of applications are being filed in a routine manner without taking any responsibility whatsoever only to harass certain persons. That apart, it becomes more disturbing and alarming when one tries to pick up people who are passing orders under a statutory provision which can be challenged under the framework of the said Act or underArticle 226of the Constitution of India. But it cannot be done to take undue advantage in a criminal court as if somebody is determined to settle the scores. 
 31. We have already indicated that there has to be prior applications underSections 154(1)and154(3)while filing a petition underSection 156(3). Both the aspects should be clearly spelt out in the application and necessary documents to that effect shall be filed. The warrant for giving a direction that an application underSection 156(3)be supported by an affidavit is so that the person making the application should be conscious and also endeavour to see that no false affidavit is made. It is because once an affidavit is found to be false, he will be liable for prosecution in accordance with law. This will deter him to casually invoke the authority of the Magistrate underSection 156(3). That apart, we have already stated that the veracity of the same can also be verified by the learned Magistrate, regard being had to the nature of allegations of the case. We are compelled to say so as a number of cases pertaining to fiscal sphere, matrimonial dispute/family disputes, commercial offences, medical negligence cases, corruption cases and the cases where there is abnormal delay/laches in initiating criminal prosecution, as are illustrated in Lalita Kumari are being filed. That apart, the learned Magistrate would also be aware of the delay in lodging of the FIR. 
 8. This judgment in Priyanka Srivastava (supra) of the Hon'ble Supreme Court has been followed subsequently in Vikram Johar versus State of Uttar Pradesh & Another reported in (2019) SCC Online SC 609. Thus, I find that the order by which the Court had referred the complaint underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure is a non-speaking one and6the complaint itself does not comply with the preconditions as set forth in the aforesaid judgment, which is necessary for sending the complaint underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 9. Considering the aforesaid fact and position of law, order by which complaint was sent underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure is absolutely bad. 
 10. So far as merit of complaint is concerned, I find that the basic allegation is for settling previous dispute, i.e., Police Station Case No.86 of 2018, the parties met in a Hotel. From paragraph 7, it is clear that since long there was some dispute going on between the parties. In paragraph 8, it has been stated that accused No.2 has threatened the complainant that if the said case is not withdrawn, then the reputation of the complainant in his business will be hampered and the loss and damage will be beyond repair and if the case is withdrawn, then a compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- will be given to the complainant. In paragraph 10, it has also been mentioned that the accused No.1 dishonestly induced the complainant that he can turn the table and bring change in the scenario for which accused has to pay Rs.20,00,000/-. This offer and exchange went on between the parties during the talks of settlement, which took place in a hotel at Bokaro. I find that the complainant has only mentioned that because of this he felt threatened and he was in a fear of death. I find that this exchange of words cannot be said that there was any fear of death. Further this alleged demand of Rs.20,00,000/- or making an offer of Rs.10,00,000/- cannot be said to be an extortion or putting pressure. In course of arriving at a settlement, these offers were given.Section 383of the Indian Penal Code defines extortion, which is as under: - 
 383 : - Extortion - Whoever intentionally puts any person in fear of any injury to that person, or to any other, and thereby dishonestly induces the person so put in fear to deliver to any person any property or valuable security, or anything signed or sealed which may be converted into a valuable security commits 'extortion'. 
 The essential ingredients ofSection 383of the Indian Penal Code are as under: - 
 (1) The accused must put any person in fear of injury to that person or any other person; (2) The putting of fear in such person must be intentional. 
 (3) The accused must thereby induce the person so that in fear to deliver to any person any property, valuable security or anything so signed or sealed which may be converted into a valuable security; and (4) Such inducement must be done dishonestly. 
 As per the allegations in the complaint petition, there are no ingredients which in any manner can constitute the essential ingredients to constitute the offence underSection 383of the Indian Penal Code. 
 11.Section 385of the Indian Penal Code is defined as under:- 
 385 : - Putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion - Whoever, in order to the committing of extortion, puts any person in fear or attempts to put any person in fear, of any injury, shall be punished with imprisonment, which may extend to 2 years or with fine or both. 
 The essential ingredients ofSection 385of the Indian Penal Code are as under: - 
 (1) Accused put or attempted to put any person in fear of injury; 
 (2) He did so to commit extortion. 
 From the facts of this case, I also do not find any ingredients to attractSection 385of the Indian Penal Code, as there is nothing to substantiate that there was a fear of injury. Mere putting a sentence that person was under fear of injury and life is not enough. 
 12.Section 387of the Indian Penal Code reads as under:- 
 387 : - Putting person in fear of death or of grievous hurt in order to commit extortion - Whoever, in order to the committing of extortion, puts or attempts to put any person in fear of death or of grievous hurt to that person or to any other shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 7 years and shall also be liable to fine. 
 The essential ingredients ofSection 387of the Indian Penal Code are as under: - 
 (1) Accused put some person or attempted to put some person in fear of death or grievous hurt; and (2) He did so to commit extortion. 
 On the facts of this case, as narrated above, the aforesaid Section is also not attracted. 
 13.Section 503of the Indian Penal Code reads as under:- 
 503 : - Criminal Intimidation - Whoever, threatens another with any injury to his person, reputation or property, or to the person or reputation of anyone in whom that person is interested, with intent to cause alarm to that person or cause that person to do any act which he is not legally bound to do, or to omit to do any act which that person is legally entitled to do, as the means of avoiding the execution of such threat, commits criminal intimidation. 
 The essential ingredients ofSection 503of the Indian Penal Code are as under: - 
 (1) Any person threatens another with - 
 a. Injury to his person, reputation or property; or b. To any other person in whom that person is interested; 
 (2) Such threat is with respect to do or to omit to do any act which that person is legally entitled to do; 
 From the allegations in the complaint petition, no offence underSection 503of the Indian Penal Code even is made out as against the petitioners. 
 14. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Haryana & Others versus Bhajan Lal & Others reported in (1992) Supp (1) SCC 335 at paragraph 102 of the said judgment has framed various categories of cases by way of illustration for exercise of the extraordinary power underArticle 226of the Constitution of India or the exercise of inherent powers underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. The said paragraph 102 of the said judgment reads as under: - 
 102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisionsof the Codeunder Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary9power underArticle 226or the inherent powers underSection 482of the Code which we have extracted and reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelized and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised. 
 (1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused. 
 (2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers underSection 156(1)of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview ofSection 155(2)of the Code. 
 (3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused. 
 (4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without any order of a Magistrate as contemplated underSection 155(2)of the Code. 
 (5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. 
 (6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisionsof the Codeor the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision inthe Codeor the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party. 
 (7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge."" 
 15. Thus, based on the discussions as above, in the light of the guidelines laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bhajan Lal (supra), I find that this case is a fit case and falls in Category (1) and (5) of the above guidelines laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court for exercise of inherent powers underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, I am inclined to allow this criminal miscellaneous petition. The entire criminal proceeding in B.S. City Police Station Case No.05 of 2019, so far as it relates to the petitioners, abovenamed, is hereby quashed. All subsequent proceedings are also quashed. 
 16. This criminal miscellaneous petition, accordingly, stands allowed. I.A. No.5590 of 2019 also stands disposed of.

 1. Petitioner, through this criminal miscellaneous petition has prayed for quashing the entire criminal proceeding, including First Information Report of Sector 4 Police Station Case No.86 of 2018 and all subsequent proceedings thereto lodged for the offence punishable underSections 406,420of the Indian Penal Code, pending in the Court of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate at Bokaro.

Counsel for the parties in course of arguments, submitted that this criminal miscellaneous petition can be disposed of at the stage of 'Orders' itself, so they finally argued at length. After hearing the parties, the final order was reserved, which is being delivered today.

The first information report was registered on the basis of complaint case being Complaint Petition No.687 of 2018, which was forwarded by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bokaro by order dated 07.07.2018 for registering the FIR and investigating the same in terms ofSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is alleged by the complainant-opposite party No.2 that the complainant is the Managing Partner of M/s. Kaizen Growth. It is alleged that he came in contact with Senior Executive of M/s Thermax Limited for making boiler/turbines and equipments for power and steel plant installation and both companies entered into a contract under specific terms and conditions to execute installation of power plants. It is alleged that firstly an agreement was signed for the first order of M/s. Adhunik Mettalik, Jamshedpur for installation of 30 MW power plant @ Rs.98 crore and2the order was placed on Thermax Limited and Kaizen Growth was the consultant/Liasoning Agent for this order, which was successfully executed on the agreed terms between the two companies and was fully maintained to the best of satisfaction. It has been alleged that on the successful performance by the firm of the complainant, M/s Thermax Limited again entered into an agreement for a large power plant project of SAIL/Rourkela Steel Plant (Orissa) vide work order No. P/Proj/287(II) 79001/77 dated 06.09.2007 for a value of Rs.418 crore. The agreement value of the complainant was Rs.2 crore on prorate basis. This large project took eight years to complete, i.e., from 2007 to 2015. It has been alleged that thereafter, yet again, an agreement was done with the complainant by M/s Thermax Limited for SAIL, Bhilai Steel Plant Project, where project was of Rs.700 crore. The accused Company M/s Thermax Limited made 4th agreement with the complainant for a water treatment project contract for SAIL/ Bokaro Steel Plant, CRM Zone under Tender No. T&C(M)/B 351/042 A/Skk/231 dated 18.03.2013. It has been alleged that in the year 2013, Income Tax Department conducted a survey on M/s. Thermax Limited at its Head Office at Mumbai Pune Road, Wakdewadi; Pune. All documents relating to the accused and complainant's company were also sent to Commissioner Central Excise, Pune for detail verification. It has been alleged that the petitioner was asked by the Commissioner, Central Excise, Pune I about Thermax's business relation with the company of the complainant M/s Kaizen Growth. It has been alleged that to the great surprise and shock of the complainant, the petitioner stated on oath that M/s Thermax Limited does not hold any business relation with the company of the complainant M/s. Kaizen Growth and has not received any services from M/s. Kaizen Growth. It has been alleged that this false and fraudulent statement made by the petitioner came as a turning point in the long business relation between them and the complainant's company M/s. Kaizen Growth was issued notices by the Dy. Commisioner, Pune (Central Excise) to explain and produce all related documents/payments/vouchers etc. to establish and find out the truth. The complainant produced all the related documents as demanded by the Dy. Commissioner. The complainant visited 5 times to Pune and the statement of the complainant was duly recorded by the Commissioner Office Superintendent on the business relation with M/s. Thermax Limited. It has been alleged that special audit was deputed to find facts and figures of the complainant's company M/s Kaizen Growth's financial and business relation with M/s Thermax Limited, Pune. It has been alleged that the petitioner has3made false and fraudulent statement to save CENVAT of Thermax Limited to the tune of Rs.32,55,78,926/-. It has been averred that it was established by the Commissioner that the petitioner fraudulently gave false statement to the Revenue Department on the business relation with the complainant which was based on written agreement. It has been alleged that all payments from M/s. Thermax to M/s. Kaizen Growth was made properly through account payee cheques after deduction of TDS and all service taxes were paid by the complainant's company M/s. Kaizen Growth as per Rules laid down covering all agreements. It has been averred that having gone through all documents, the Commissioner Central Excise, Pune imposed a heavy fine of Rs.10 lakh on the petitioner and a penalty was imposed along with interest on M/s. Thermax for Rs.1,34,60,350/-. It has been alleged that the petitioner paid these fines/penalty charges along with Rs.10,000/- as fine imposed upon the company of the complainant M/s. Kaizen Growth. It has been alleged that due to the abovesaid activities of the accused company and petitioner, the reputation of the company of complainant, i.e., M/s. Kaizen Growth was totally damaged because of false/fraudulent statement/affidavit given by the petitioner. It has been alleged that the market image of the complainant's company was totally shattered and then after the complainant's company did not get a single contract from any company despite the clean chit given by the Central Excise Department to M/s. Kaizen Growth. It has been alleged that to the extent when M/s Thermax Limited bagged an order of SAIL, Bokaro Steel Plant recently for a contract in RMPH Zone of SAIL, Bokaro Steel Plant, but the complainant's company was refused by M/s. Thermax Limited inspite of their commitments to work together for any SAIL projects in future. It has been alleged that the complainant represented/requested the petitioner through registered letter and reminded their old relation for all SAIL projects, but the petitioner has not responded the same. It has been alleged that the complainant also approached the local officials of M/s. Thermax Limited at Bokaro, Project Manager Mr. Manoj Jha on 03.07.2019, but of no result as he did not want even to talk to the complainant on mobile inspite of their 10 years deep business relation with M/s. Thermax Limited. It has been alleged that due to the above activities of the accused company, the marketing reputation of the complainant and his company suffered a huge loss by loosing their best business and reputation in National and International arena since then. It has been alleged that due to false and fraudulent acts of the petitioner, turn over of the complainant's company came down drastically from Rs.1 crore to NIL,4because he lost all clients and reputations in the market, even for the job, which M/s. Kaizen Growth had executed in past for the company namely M/s. Imeco Limited, Kolkata and M/s. Magadh Engineering Works, Industrial Area, Balidih, Bokaro Steel City. It has been alleged that M/s. Kaizen Growth in past executed with M/s. Imeco Limited, Kolkata, an EPC contract for six number of ESP/RMP Bokaro, order, but, when a fresh tender dated 13.03.2016 came for the same item, in Bokaro, M/s. Imeco Ltd. even on request refused to make an agreement with M/s. Kaizen Growth because of legal complication created by M/s. Thermax Limited (accused) for no fault of the complainant's company. It has been alleged that furthermore at the instance of the employees, who were looking for M/s Thermax Project with the complainant, took nearly Rs.10 lakh from the complainant including Rs.4 lakh cash. These payments were made to them through account payee cheques. These payments were made on refundable basis but payment was never refunded to the complainant. It has been alleged that to utmost surprise, being Thermax registered vendor, having Vendor Code No.133000 with M/s. Thermax Limited, who lied before the Commissioner and gave false and fraudulent on oath that caused the complainant a serious suffering mentally, financially and socially. In the circumstances set forth above, defamation that ruined the prestige, dignity of the complainant as well as his company by the petitioner, complainant sought Rs.3 crore against defamation plus Rs.10 lakh paid to them as per bank receipts. 
 4. Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner, submits that even if the complaint is taken on its face value, no offence underSections 406/420of the Indian Penal Code is made out. He submits that the facts stated in the complaint, even if it is true, it suggests that the petitioner's company gave some false statement before the Income Tax Department with respect to the business relations of the petitioner company with the complainant. He submits that the aforesaid action cannot be said to be a criminal offence underthe Indian Penal Code. Further, he submits that even if paragraph 20 of the complaint is seen, it would be evident that the fine amount, which was imposed upon the complainant company was also paid by the petitioner company, which would go to show that there was no criminal intention. He submits that if there was any act (without admitting the same), which attracts an offence, it can at best be of saving of CENVAT by giving false statement, for which the petitioner company has already been penalized by the Revenue Authorities. By no stretch of imagination, the same can attract5any offence underthe Indian Penal Code. He submits that the claim of the complainant that his company suffered defamation, which ruined his prestige and dignity, cannot be a subject matter of criminal proceeding underSections 406,420of the Indian Penal Code. He submits that even the statement made in paragraph 28 of the complaint petition to the effect that some officers of M/s Thermax Limited (company of the petitioner) had taken Rs.10,00,000/- on refundable basis, but, did not refund the same, cannot also be a subject matter of the criminal case. He lastly submits that in utter violation of the provisions ofSection 154(1)andSection 154(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Court, without applying its mind, has exercised jurisdiction underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure and directed the police to register a First Information Report. 
 5. Learned counsel appearing for the opposite party opposes the prayer of the petitioner and submits that the petitioner had given a false statement before the Revenue Authorities for which the petitioner company suffered loss, as he was deprived of future business transactions. He submits that the complainant suffered mental harassment by loosing their future businesses. He submits that by making a false statement and taking CENVAT relief, is an offence, thus, offence underSection 420of the Indian Penal Code is made out. 
 6. After hearing the parties, I find that the petitioner company had a business relation with the Company of the complainant. When the Income Tax Department conducted survey upon M/s Thermax Limited (petitioner's company) it is alleged that statements were given by the petitioners that they had no business relations with the company of the opposite party No.2. The complainant was called to produce all the related documents, which they had. Thereafter it was concluded by the Revenue Authorities that M/s Thermax Limited has made false statement to save CENVAT and M/s. Thermax Limited gave a false information that they had no relations with the company of the opposite party No.2. The Commissioner, Central Excise imposed a fine of Rs.10,00,000/- upon this petitioner, who is Managing Director of M/s. Thermax Limited along with interest. In paragraph 19 of the complaint petition, the complainant admits that M.S. Unikrishnan paid the fine and also the penal charges, which was imposed upon the complainant. It is the case of the complainant that because of this act, reputation of complainant's company was damaged. It is also the complainant's case that even though there was some arrangement between the complainant and the accused that the accused will6work together in future Government projects, but, the accused refused to do any business with the complainant. The complainant further stated that because of the aforesaid activity, the reputation of the complainant's company suffered a set-back and the turn over of the complainant's company came down from Rs.1 crore to NIL. As per the complainant, because of this act, he suffered mentally, financially and socially and thus, as per paragraph 13 of the complaint, he sought Rs.3 crore as defamation plus Rs.10 lakh as recovery amount, which, according to him, was paid to some of the officers of the petitioner's company. 
 7. The facts, which are narrated above, are derived from the complaint itself. These facts, by no stretch of imagination, attract the offences punishable underSections 420or 406of the Indian Penal Code. 
 9.Section 420of the Indian Penal Code is punishment for cheating, which reads as under: - 
 420. Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property - Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine. 
 To attract an offence underSection 420of the Indian Penal Code, the following requirements must be present: - 
 (i) Cheating; 
 (ii) dishonest inducement to deliver property or to make, alter or destroy any valuable security or anything which is sealed or signed or is capable of being converted into a valuable security; and 
 (iii) mens rea of the accused at the time of making inducement. 
 Section 415of the Indian Penal Code defines cheating, which reads as follows: - 
 415. Cheating - Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, or7intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to 'cheat'. 
 The essential ingredients of the offence of 'cheating' are: - 
 (i) deception of a person either by making a false or misleading representation or by other action or omission; 
 (ii) fraudulent or dishonest inducement of that person to either deliver any property or to consent to the retention thereof by any person or to intentionally induce that person to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property. 
 9. From a conjoint reading of aforesaid sections vis-à-vis the present case, I find that there is no allegation of delivering any property to any person, nor there is any allegation of altering or destroying any security. The element of deception vis-à-vis the complainant is missing in this case. The best allegation against the petitioner is that he suppressed the business relations between the petitioner and the complainant company with the Revenue Authorities to save tax. For this the complainant cannot be said to have been cheated. The revenue authorities, which was the only appropriate authority, has already imposed punishment upon the petitioner's company as per law. 
 Thus, there is no application ofSection 420of the Indian Penal Code in this case. 
 10.Section 406is a punishment for criminal breach of trust. The word 'criminal breach of trust' is defined inSection 405of the Indian Penal Code, which reads as under: - 
 405. Criminal breach of trust - Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract,8express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or willfully suffers any other person so to do, commits 'criminal breach of trust'. 
 11. From the facts narrated above, which is there in the complaint petition, I find that the petitioner was not entrusted with any property by the complainant nor did he dishonestly misappropriate or convert any property for his own use. On the facts stated above,Section 406of the Indian Penal Code is also not applicable in this case. 
 12. These are the only two sections under which the first information report has been registered. Since there are no ingredients ofSections 406and420of the Indian Penal Code, registering of first information report is absolutely bad. 
 13. Furthermore, the remedy available underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not routine in nature. It requires application of mind and a speaking order to be passed. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Priyanka Srivastava & Another versus the State of Uttar Pradesh & Others reported in (2015) 6 SCC 287, has dealt with this issue extensively. In the aforesaid judgment, the Hon'ble Court highlighted the importance ofSection 154(1)andSection 154(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure and has also dealt with the mis-use of the powers underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In paragraph 30 and 31 of the aforesaid judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in detail, has held as to how the Court has to deal in this situation. Paragraphs 30 and 31 of the said judgment reads as under: - 
 30. In our considered opinion, a stage has come in this country whereSection 156(3)CrPC applications are to be supported by an affidavit duly sworn by the applicant who seeks the invocation of the jurisdiction of the Magistrate. That apart, in an appropriate case, the learned Magistrate would be well advised to verify the truth and also can verify the veracity of the allegations. This affidavit can make the applicant more responsible. We are compelled to say so as such kind of applications are being filed in a routine manner without taking any responsibility whatsoever only to harass certain persons. That apart, it becomes more disturbing and alarming when one tries to pick up people who are passing orders under a statutory provision which can be challenged under the framework of the said Act or underArticle 226of the Constitution of India. But it cannot be done to take9undue advantage in a criminal court as if somebody is determined to settle the scores. 
 31. We have already indicated that there has to be prior applications underSections 154(1)and154(3)while filing a petition underSection 156(3). Both the aspects should be clearly spelt out in the application and necessary documents to that effect shall be filed. The warrant for giving a direction that an application underSection 156(3)be supported by an affidavit is so that the person making the application should be conscious and also endeavour to see that no false affidavit is made. It is because once an affidavit is found to be false, he will be liable for prosecution in accordance with law. This will deter him to casually invoke the authority of the Magistrate underSection 156(3). That apart, we have already stated that the veracity of the same can also be verified by the learned Magistrate, regard being had to the nature of allegations of the case. We are compelled to say so as a number of cases pertaining to fiscal sphere, matrimonial dispute/family disputes, commercial offences, medical negligence cases, corruption cases and the cases where there is abnormal delay/laches in initiating criminal prosecution, as are illustrated in Lalita Kumari are being filed. That apart, the learned Magistrate would also be aware of the delay in lodging of the FIR. 
 14. This judgment in Priyanka Srivastava (supra) of the Hon'ble Supreme Court has been followed subsequently in Vikram Johar versus State of Uttar Pradesh & Another reported in (2019) SCC Online SC 609. Thus, I find that the order by which the Court had referred the complaint underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure is a non-speaking one and the complaint itself does not comply with the preconditions as set forth in the aforesaid judgment, which is necessary for sending the complaint underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 15. Considering the aforesaid fact and position of law, order by which complaint was sent underSection 156(3)of the Code of Criminal Procedure is absolutely bad. 
 16. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Haryana & Others versus Bhajan Lal & Others reported in (1992) Supp (1) SCC 335 at paragraph 102 of the said judgment has framed various categories of cases by way of illustration for exercise of the extraordinary power underArticle 226of10the Constitution of India or the exercise of inherent powers underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. The said paragraph 102 of the said judgment reads as under: - 
 102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisionsof the Codeunder Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power underArticle 226or the inherent powers underSection 482of the Code which we have extracted and reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelized and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised. 
 (1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused. 
 (2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers underSection 156(1)of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview ofSection 155(2)of the Code. 
 (3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused. 
 (4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without any order of a Magistrate as contemplated underSection 155(2)of the Code. 
 (5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that11there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. 
 (6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisionsof the Codeor the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision inthe Codeor the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party. 
 (7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge."" 
 17. Thus, based on the discussions as above, in the light of the guidelines laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bhajan Lal (supra), I find that this case is a fit case and falls in Category (1) and (5) of the above guidelines laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court for exercise of inherent powers underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, I am inclined to allow this criminal miscellaneous petition. The entire criminal proceeding in Sector 4 Police Station Case No.86 of 2018, so far as it relates to the petitioner, abovenamed, is hereby quashed. All subsequent proceedings also stand quashed. 
 18. This criminal miscellaneous petition, accordingly, stands allowed.

 3/02.09.2020 Heard the parties. 
 Since in both these applications, a common issue is involved, the same are being disposed of by this common order. 
 Petitioners are accused in connection with ECIR/02/PAT/11/AD. It has been alleged that the petitioner Manoj Kumar @ Manoj Kumar Singh (in B. A. No. 2134 of 2020) while working as a Private Secretary to Sri Mrigendra Pratap Singh, the then Vidhan Sabha Speaker, Jharkhand during the period from August 2004 to December 2004 and subsequently to Sri Chandra Prakash Choudhary, the then Minister of Water Supply and Sanitation during the period 09.10.2006 to 23.08.2008 had in the name of Sri Manoj Singh (HUF) acquired assets worth Rs. 12,95,47,971/- which is disproportionate to his known sources of income. It has been alleged that Sri Manoj Singh had acquired proceeds of crime and placed the said proceeds of crime in the form of fixed deposit and other deposits. In the commission of the said offence, Sri Manoj Kumar Singh had been intentionally assisted by the other accused persons. 
 Based on the aforesaid allegation, a complaint case was lodged which was registered as ECIR/02/PAT/11/AD in which cognizance has been taken for the offences underSections 3and4of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. 
 The background facts prior to the institution of the complaint is-2-that on 15.10.2009 and 21.10.2009, searches were conducted by the Income Tax Department at Ranchi and in the village of Sri Manoj Kumar, in course of which there was a recovery of 169 fixed deposit receipts investing Rs. 12,54,45, 499/- with Uttar Pradesh Chhetriya Gramin Bank, Magarpal, Murtaza branch, Chhapra; 24 fixed deposits worth Rs. 12,75,000/- invested with United Bank of India, R. K. Mission Extension Counter, Morhabadi, Ranchi; Rs. 4,49,000/- in the savings bank account of Sri Manoj Kumar in United Bank of India, R. K. Mission Extension Counter, Morhabadi, Ranchi and Rs. 23,77,977 from the savings bank account of Sri Manoj Kumar from Uttar Pradesh Chhetriya Gramin Bank, Magarpal, Murtaza branch, Chhapra. 
 Pursuant to the search and seizure as indicated above, the Vigilance Bureau, Jharkhand had registered an FIR being Vigilance Case No. 23 of 2009. On completion of investigation, charge-sheet has been submitted only against Sri Manoj Kumar underSections 13(1) (E) read withSection 13(2) of thePrevention of Corruption ActandSections 467,468,469,471and420of I.P.C. and accordingly cognizance was also taken under the aforesaid provisions of law. The order taking cognizance was challenged by Sri Manoj Kumar Singh in Cr.M.P. No. 1913 of 2013 and vide order dated 07.03.2014, the order dated 16.04.2010 under which cognizance was taken underSections 467,468,469,471and420of I.P.C. was set aside. Pursuant to the charge-sheet submitted by the Vigilance Bureau, the Directorate of Enforcement had instituted the complaint case. 
 It has been stated by Mr. Rajendra Krishna, learned counsel for the petitioners that in B.A. No. 2134 of 2020 in the Vigilance Case, the petitioner had been granted bail by this Court in B. A. No. 4392 of 2010. He has referred to the order passed in Cr.M.P. No. 1913 of 2013 by which the cognizance order dated 16.04.2010 was set aside so far asSections 467,468,469,471and420I.P.C. are concerned. Learned counsel furthers his argument by stating that the petitioner has fully cooperated in investigation and documents in defence was also submitted. He has stated that the petitioner Manoj Kumar had given suitable explanation regarding his unsourced income. Reference has been made to the communication of the Circle Officer which categorises the agricultural income of the petitioner - Manoj Kumar. The agricultural income is-3-itself to the tune of Rs. one crore. Mr. Rajendra Krishna has further submitted that the gold and diamonds were purchased from the agricultural income from time immemorial. The gold and diamonds were taken to the Valuer Sri Ramesh Kumar Soni for the valuation and the cost of the gold and diamonds were assessed at Rs. 10 crores approximately. He has also drawn the attention of the Court to the statement of Sri Ramesh Kumar Soni recorded underSection 15of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, in which he has stated about the valuation done and the charges taken by him and which has been shown in the Income Tax return for the financial year 2005-06. It has been submitted that the petitioner has given suitable explanation about his income and it cannot be said that the income generated by the petitioner was from the proceeds of crime. Mr. Rajendra Krishna has also referred to the case of ""Shri P. Chidambaram Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation"" reported in 2020 (1) JBCJ 28 (SC) and has stated that the criteria laid down for grant of bail does not disentitle the petitioner to the same. He has further submitted that the petitioner is in custody since 15.02.2020 and no custodial interrogation of the petitioner is required. So far as the petitioners in B. A. No. 2806 of 2020 are concerned, learned counsel submits that the petitioners have been implicated for being the brothers of Manoj Kumar. In course of investigation, none of the witnesses have taken the name of these petitioners. It has been stated that both the petitioners are in custody since 28.02.2020. Learned counsel for the petitioners has also referred to a judgment in the case of ""Sanjay Chandra vs. Central Bureau of Investigation"" reported in (2012) 1 SCC 
 40. Mr. Amit Kumar Das and Mr. Prashant Vidyarthy, learned counsel for the Directorate of Enforcement have drawn the attention of the court to the investigation which came to the conclusion that Valuer had prepared the valuation report without physical verification, only for the purposes of pecuniary gain. While relying on the investigation, reference has been made to the purported sale of diamonds by the accused Manoj Kumar which were found to be false. He has also submitted that the agricultural income as shown by the accused Manoj Kumar, in view of the statement of some of the buyers has also been-4-falsified. Learned counsels also indicated about the conduct of the petitioners to the effect that they had only surrendered once processes underSections 82&83Cr.P.C. have been issued. It has been submitted that thePrevention of Corruption Actand thePrevention of Money Laundering Actoperate in different fields with respect to the factors guiding consideration of bail. Mr. Das has submitted that in the case of ""Shri P. Chidambaram"" (supra), bail was granted on the parameters of the accused person being aged 74 years and was suffering from illness. In such circumstances, as noted above, a prayer has been made for rejecting the bail applications preferred by the petitioners. 
 In course of investigation by the Vigilance Bureau, it was detected that so far as the valuation of gold and diamonds are concerned, the jewellery was not physically taken to the Valuer, but instead the Valuer had given a back dated valuation report and in lieu thereof, he was given an amount of Rs. 1,26,042/-. Sri Ramesh Kumar Soni, the Valuer in his statement underSection 15of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act has specifically stated about the valuation being made after the gold and diamonds were brought before him by the accused which is contrary to what has been stated by him before the Vigilance Bureau. In course of investigation, it has also come that the petitioner Manoj Kumar had submitted some invoices in support of his claim regarding sale of diamonds worth Rs. 8,17,21,664/- to one M/s. Star Traders, Mumbai/Surat which was a proprietorship firm of Raj Kumar Patodia. However, the income tax return does not indicate regarding the claim of Sri Manoj Kumar about the sale of diamonds as stated above. It has also come during course of investigation that the address of M/s. Star Traders has been given in the invoices submitted by Sri Manoj Kumar which is apparently false as there is no firm in existence in the name of M/s. Star Traders at Surat. In fact the son of Raj Kumar Patodia had denied being aware of any purchase of diamond or of the residential address of his father which had been provided by the petitioner - Manoj Kumar. In fact, with respect to the agricultural income for which reliance has been placed on various documents by the learned counsel for the petitioner, but in course of investigation, the statements of several persons who were said to have purchased the agricultural produce have stated-5-otherwise which also contradicts the claim of the petitioner - Manoj Kumar Singh regarding his explanation with respect to the income from agricultural produce. So far as the petitioner in B. A. No. 2806 of 2020 is concerned, they appear to have been implicated being the brothers of the main accused - Sri Manoj Kumar. 
 At this juncture, it would be relevant to refer to some of the pronouncements which have been relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioners. In the case of ""Shri P. Chidambaram Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation"" (supra), it has been held with respect to the factors guiding consideration of bail as follows: 
 22. ""The jurisdiction to grant bail has to be exercised on the basis of the well-settled principles having regard to the facts and circumstances of each case. The following factors are to be taken into consideration while considering an application for bail:- (i) the nature of accusation and the severity of the punishment in the case of conviction and the nature of the materials relied upon by the prosecution; (ii) reasonable apprehension of tampering with the witnesses or apprehension of threat to the complainant or the witnesses; (iii) reasonable possibility of securing the presence of the accused at the time of trial or the likelihood of his abscondence; 
 (iv) character behaviour and standing of the accused and the circumstances which are peculiar to the accused; (v) larger interest of the public or the State and similar other considerations (videPrahlad Singh Bhati v. NCT, Delhi(2001) 4 SCC 280). There is no hard and fast rule regarding grant or refusal to grant bail. Each case has to be considered on the facts and circumstances of each case and on its own merits. The discretion of the court has to be exercised judiciously and not in an arbitrary manner. At this stage itself, it is necessary for us to indicate that we are unable to accept the contention of the learned Solicitor General that ""flight risk"" of economic offenders should be looked at as a national phenomenon and be dealt with in that manner merely because certain other offenders have flown out of the country. The same cannot, in our view, be put in a straight-jacket formula so as to deny bail to the one who is before the Court, due to the conduct of other offenders, if the person under consideration is otherwise entitled to bail on the merits of his own case. Hence, in our view, such consideration including as to ""flight risk"" is to be made on individual basis being uninfluenced by the unconnected cases, more so, when the personal liberty is involved."" 
 In the case of ""Sanjay Chandra vs. Central Bureau of Investigation"" (supra), it has been held as follows: 
 21. ""In bail applications, generally, it has been laid down from the earliest times that the object of bail is to secure the appearance of the accused person at his trial by reasonable amount of bail. The object of bail is neither punitive nor preventative. Deprivation of liberty must be considered a punishment, unless it is required to-6-ensure that an accused person will stand his trial when called upon. The courts owe more than verbal respect to the principle that punishment begins after conviction, and that every man is deemed to be innocent until duly tried and duly found guilty. 
 22. From the earliest times, it was appreciated that detention in custody pending completion of trial could be a cause of great hardship. From time to time, necessity demands that some unconvicted persons should be held in custody pending trial to secure their attendance at the trial but in such cases, ""necessity"" is the operative test. In this country, it would be quite contrary to the concept of personal liberty enshrined in the Constitution that any person should be punished in respect of any matter, upon which, he has not been convicted or that in any circumstances, he should be deprived of his liberty upon only the belief that he will tamper with the witnesses if left at liberty, save in the most extraordinary circumstances. 
 23. Apart from the question of prevention being the object of refusal of bail, one must not lose sight of the fact that any imprisonment before conviction has a substantial punitive content and it would be improper for any court to refuse bail as a mark of disapproval of former conduct whether the accused has been convicted for it or not or to refuse bail to an unconvicted person for the purpose of giving him a taste of imprisonment as a lesson. 
 24. In the instant case, we have already noticed that the ""pointing finger of accusation"" against the appellants is ""the seriousness of the charge"". The offences alleged are economic offences which have resulted in loss to the State exchequer. Though, they contend that there is a possibility of the appellants tampering with the witnesses, they have not placed any material in support of the allegation. In our view, seriousness of the charge is, no doubt, one of the relevant considerations while considering bail applications but that is not the only test or the factor: the other factor that also requires to be taken note of is the punishment that could be imposed after trial and conviction, both underthe Penal Codeand thePrevention of Corruption Act. Otherwise, if the former is the only test, we would not be balancing the constitutional rights but rather ""recalibrating the scales of justice"". 
 25. The provisions ofCrPCconfer discretionary jurisdiction on criminal courts to grant bail to the accused pending trial or in appeal against convictions; since the jurisdiction is discretionary, it has to be exercised with great care and caution by balancing the valuable right of liberty of an individual and the interest of the society in general. In our view, the reasoning adopted by the learned District Judge, which is affirmed by the High Court, in our opinion, is a denial of the whole basis of our system of law and normal rule of bail system. It transcends respect for the requirement that a man shall be considered innocent until he is found guilty. If such power is recognised, then it may lead to-7-chaotic situation and would jeopardise the personal liberty of an individual."" 
 As has been noted in the present case, the entire allegations appear to be centered around the petitioner in B. A. No. 2134 of 2020. So far as the petitioners in B. A. No. 2806 of 2020 are concerned, there does not appear to be any specific allegation levelled against them and they being the brothers of main accused - Sri Manoj Kumar have been proceeded against in the case of money laundering. All the petitioners are in custody since 28.02.2020 and at the present juncture, no custodial interrogation is necessary. It further appears that the precursor to the investigation carried out by the Directorate of Enforcement appears to be the case instituted by the Vigilance Bureau in which the said Manoj Kumar @ Manoj Kumar Singh has been granted bail in B. A. No. 4392 of 2010. Judgments referred to above have categorically underlined the principle that the ultimate consideration in a case of bail will have to be a case to case basis on the facts involved therein and securing the presence of the accused to stand trial. 
 An economic offence is a grave offence and considering the role played by the petitioner in B. A. No. 2134 of 2020 in which he had misused his position of being the Private Secretary of the then Speaker as well as the then Minister while amassing a huge wealth which is disproportionate to his known source of income and having miserably failed to submit any appropriate explanation for such income from the proceeds of crime, I am not inclined to grant bail to him. The prayer for bail of the petitioner in B. A. No. 2134 of 2020 is hereby rejected. 
 So far as the petitioners in B. A. No. 2806 of 2020 are concerned, I am inclined to grant bail to the said petitioners. 
 Accordingly, the petitioners in B. A. No. 2806 of 2020 above named are directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each, to the satisfaction of learned Additional Judicial Commissioner I cum Special Judge, PMLA, Ranchi in connection with ECIR/02/PAT/11/AD.

 PRESENT : 
 Heard Miss. Amrita Vijay, the learned counsel for the petitioner and Mrs. Vandana Singh, the learned Sr. SC-III appearing for the2respondent State. 
 2. This writ petition has been heard through Video Conferencing in view of the guidelines of the High Court taking into account the situation arising due to COVID-19 pandemic. None of the parties have complained about any technical snag of audio-video and with their consent this matter has been heard. 
 3. The petitioner has preferred this writ petition for quashing the order contained in Memo No.727 dated 04.02.2019 [Annexure-6] issued by the respondent no.2 whereby the petitioner has been inflicted punishment of withholding the petitioner's three consecutive pay increment with non-cumulative effect and also punishment of censure. 
 4. The case of the petitioner in this writ petition is that in the year 2008 the petitioner was Junior Engineer, working in Minor Irrigation Division, Godda under Water Resources Department, Jharkhand. The respondent no.3, the DC-cum-DPC entrusted 311 MGNREGA works to respondent no.5, the Executive Engineer and also released funds from contingency head of the MGNREGA scheme for purchase of agricultural tools and implements for distrubution amongst farmers/labourers for implementation of MGNREGA works. In the financial year 2008-09, the DC-cum-DPC released contintency funds to the Executive Engineer, M.I. Division, Godda in two trenches. Subsequently, the Executive Engineer, respondent no.5 advanced a sum of Rs.1,09,890/- to the petitioner. The petitioner purchased tools and implements from the open market and distrubuted amongst the farmers/labourers through their beneficiary committee. The petitioner3submitted their accounts to the respondent no.5 Executive Engineer through Assistant Engineer, who in his turn passed the vouchers and booked under the contingency head of MGNREGA funds from which advance had been released by the DC-cum-DPC. Thereafter the issue of Head of expenditure and violation of Rules 235 and 241 of the Bihar Finance Rule was raised by the respondent no.4 which culminated in the departmental enquiry. The enquiry report was submitted in which enquiry report rules out any financial loss or even temporary embezzlement as reflected in the equiry report [Annexure- 2] and the impugned order of punishment has been passed. 
 5. The case of the respondent-State is that the petitoner has purchased agricultural tools and implements it for various labour cooperation societies /committees of beneficiaries to the farmers under the scheme of MNREGA. As per the letter of National level Monitor the tools and implements are to be supplied to the labours free of cost and should be purchased through the material head but the then Executive Engineer allotted the amount to the Junior Engineers from contingency fund and there is no provision to purchase the tools and implements from the contingency fund. For the alleged irregularity in the MNREGA scheme and for the misappropriation of public fund by the petitioner during the posting at Minor Irrigation Subdivision, Godda, the Deputy Commissioner, Godda vide letter dated 21.08.2012 proposed prapatra ""ka"" for the departmenal proceeding. Accordingly, departmental proceeding was initiated against the petitioner under the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1930. The enquiry officer4found him guilty of two charges and so far as other charges are concerned, he has been exonerated and submitted a report. The petitioner was asked to file reply to the second show cause, the reply of the second show cause was not satisfactory. The petitioner was provided the fund in the year 2009 but he deposited the same in the year 2011 hence, a case of temporary embezzlement of money is made out against the petitioner and that is why the punishment order has been passed. 
 6. The learned counsel for the petitioner has assailed the impugned order on the ground that the petitioner has also deposited the amount in question, there is no question of any embezzlement, what to say about temporary embezzlement. She submitted that the funds were properly utilized for implementation of MGNREGA scheme. The respondent no.4 resorted to the pressure tactics and compelled the Junior Engineers to refund the sanctioned amount which was advanced to them by the Executive Engineer, respondent no.5. After more than a year, a departmental proceeding was initiated against the petitioner. She submitted that the amount in qustion has already been deposited, thus, there is no embezzlement. The enquiry officer finally submitted the enquiry report and he found that there is no case of embezzlement, but a case of procedural mistake on the part of the petitioner may be there. She further submitted that when the enquiry officer has already exonerated the petitioner, the respondent was bound to follow the procedure prescribed in the case of ""Punjab National Bank v. Kunj Bihari Mishra"" reported in (1998) 7 SCC 84. She further relied in the case of5""Md. Noorul Hoda v. The State of Jharkhand and Ors."" [W.P.(S) No.2201 of 2019] rendered by a coordinate Bench of this Court and submitted that the case of the petitioner is fully covered in the light of the judgment of a coordinate Bench. She further relied in the case of ""Satish Sharma v. The State of Jharkhand & Ors."" [W.P.(S) No.2357 of 2019]. By way of referring to these two judegments, she further submitted that the case of the petitioner is fully covered in view of the coordinate Bench judgments (supra). 
 7. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent State submitted that the judgment relied by the learned counsel for the petitioner are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case. She further submitted that so far these two cases of coordinate Benches are concerned, are passed on the basis of Rule 43(b) of Jharkhand Pension Rules, whereas in the present case, the petitioner is working and in that view of the matter, that judgments are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case. She further submitted that there is financial embezzlement and that is why there is no illegality in the punishment order. Mrs. Vandana Singh, the learned State counsel relied in the case of ""State of M eghalaya v. Mecken Singh N. Marak"" reported in (2008) 7 SCC 580, at page 583. Paragraph no.14 of the said judgment is quoted hereinbelow : 
 14. In the matter of imposition of sentence, the scope for interference is very limited and restricted to exceptional cases. The jurisdiction of the High Court, to interfere with the quantum of punishment is limited and cannot be exercised without sufficient reasons. The High Court, although has jurisdiction in appropriate case, to consider the question in regard to the quantum of punishment, but it has a limited role6to play. It is now well settled that the High Courts, in exercise of powers underArticle 226, do not interfere with the quantum of punishment unless there exist sufficient reasons therefor. The punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority or the appellate authority unless shocking to the conscience of the court, cannot be subjected to judicial review. In the impugned order of the High Court no reasons whatsoever have been indicated as to why the punishment was considered disproportionate. Failure to give reasons amounts to denial of justice. The mere statement that it is disproportionate would not suffice. 
 8. The Court has proceeded to examine the arguments advanced on behalf of the parties. The Court has perused the enquiry report wherein it is transpired that the enquiry officer has come to the conclusion that there is no case of embezzlement of Government fund is made out against the petitioner. However, the procedural lacuna has been indicated in the enquiry report by the petitioner. The cases relied by the learned counsel for the petitioner are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case as in those cases, the Hon'ble Bench has passed the order on the strength of Rule 43 (b) of the Jharkhand Pension Rules as in that case the petitioner was retired person and claiming for his pension and the said order was passed and in the present case, the petitioners are in service thus, those cases are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case. So far as the case rendered in the case of ""Punjab National Bank v. Kunj Bihari Mishra"" (supra) is concerned that is also not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case and there is no complete exoneration by the enquiry officer in view of the fact other procedural part is concerned. The second show cause has also been issued to the7petitioner and the petitioner has complied and after that the disciplinary authority has passed the order. It is well-settled provision of law that loss of confidence is primary factor, not the amount of money misappropriated. A temporary embezzlement is also a misconduct. Reference in this regard may be made in ""Diwanj Singh v. Life Insurance Corporation of India and Ors."" reported in (2015) 2 SCC 341. Paragraph no.8, 9 and 10 of the said judgment are quoted hereinbelow : 
 ""8. As far as argument relating to quantum of punishment, as modified by the High Court, which results in consequential forfeiture of pensionary benefits in view of Rule 23, quoted above, is concerned, we do not find the punishment to be harsh or disproportionate to the guilt, in view of the nature of the charge of which the appellant is found guilty in the present case. Time and again, this Court has consistently held that in such matters no sympathy should be shown by the courts. 
 9. In NEKRTC v. H. Amaresh, this Court, in para 18 of the judgment has expressed the views on this point as under: 
 ""18. In the instant case, the misappropriation of the funds by the delinquent employee was only Rs 360.95. This Court has considered the punishment that may be awarded to the delinquent employees who misappropriated the funds of the Corporation and the factors to be considered. This Court in a catena of judgments held that the loss of confidence is the primary factor and not the amount of money misappropriated and that the sympathy or generosity cannot be a factor which is impermissible in law. When an employee is found guilty of pilferage or of misappropriating the Corporation's funds, there is nothing wrong in the Corporation losing confidence or faith in such an employee and awarding punishment of dismissal. In such cases, there is no place for generosity or misplaced sympathy on the part of the judicial forums and interfering therefore with the quantum of punishment."" 
 10.In Karnataka SRTC v. A.T. Mane4in which unaccounted amount was only Rs 93 this Court expressed its opinion in para 12 as under: (SCC p. 259) ""12. Coming to the question of quantum of punishment, one should bear in mind the fact that it is not the amount of money misappropriated that becomes a primary factor for awarding punishment; on the contrary, it is the loss of confidence which is the primary factor to be taken into consideration. In our opinion, when a person is found guilty of misappropriating the corporation's funds, there is nothing wrong in the corporation losing confidence or faith in such a person and awarding a punishment of dismissal."" 
 9. So far as the judgment relied by the learned counsel for the respondent in the case of ""State of Meghalaya v. Mecken Singh N. Marak"" reported in (2008) 7 SCC 580 is concerned, the Court is in agreement that the Court generally did not interfere underArticle 226of the Constitution of India if the punishment is on the well-founded basis, but in this case two punishments have been passed, which shocks the conscience of the Court.In view of settled legal proposition that the disciplinary authority on the basis of the magnitude of the misconduct is empowered to impose the punishment appropriate to the situation. The amount has already been deposited. 
 10. Thus the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner is not acceptable to the Court. The Court further finds that for such punishment, the petitioner has been punished with two punishments i.e. Withholding of three consequtive pay increments with non- cumulative effect and also of censure, which shocks the conscience of the Court and on the quantum of punishment, the writ petition9succeeds and accordingly, the impugned order dated 04.02.2019 is quashed. 
 11. The matter is remitted back to the respondent State to pass a fresh order in the light of the observation made in this judgment. 
 12. The writ petition [W.P.(S) No.5798 of 2019] stands allowed to the above extent and disposed of.

 For the Petitioner : Mr. R.S. Mazumdar, Sr. Advocate For the State : Mr. Shailesh Kumar Sinha, A.P.P. 
 ------- 
 04/02.09.2020 Heard Mr. R.S. Mazumdar, learned senior counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Shailesh Kumar Sinha, learned A.P.P. for the State. 
 The petitioner is an accused in connection with Bariyatu P.S. Case No. 123 of 2020. 
 The prosecution story in brief is that the petitioner and the informant had duty in the Covid-ICU from 21.05.2020, according to the Covid-ICU roster. During this period the informant was staying in the paying ward in Room No. D-19 on the fourth floor, which was allotted to her. The petitioner was staying at his own residence. On 27.05.2020 one patient namely Guddu Mahli had to be incubated and put on ventilator support. This led to activation of Covid-ICU at 5:30 A.M. on 27.05.2020. As the patient was a suspect of Covid-19 he had to be kept in Covid-ICU till the test report came. The informant as well as the petitioner had to look after the patient till the replacements arrived at 9:30 A.M. on 28.05.2020. Subsequently it was informed that the patient's Covid test report was 'Negative'. Since the report was negative a decision was made to shift the patient to critical care ICU which is temporarily running in the Cardiology Block. It has been alleged that after the shifting was initiated, the petitioner told the informant that his residence will be closed for the night and that the Guard at his residence was not picking his call as such the petitioner insisted to stay in the paying ward with the informant in the same room which was-2-allotted to her. Since the aforesaid proposal was not acceptable to the informant she had somehow managed to get allotted Room No. D-15 to the petitioner. It has also been alleged that the petitioner called the informant on phone and came into her room and asked her to show his room. Further allegation has been levelled that when the informant showed the petitioner his room, the petitioner asked her to provide a bottle of water and when the informant went to hand him over the same the petitioner is said to have outraged her modesty and molested her but the informant somehow managed to escape from his clutches and informed her seniors which ultimately led to institution of the First Information Report. 
 It has been stated by Mr. R.S. Mazumdar, learned senior counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner is a Doctor by profession and is working at present as a Senior Resident in (PDCC, Critical Care) in the Trauma Department of RIMS, Ranchi since 05.08.2019. Learned senior counsel submits that in the wake of the pandemic the petitioner was directed to work in the Covid-19 team from 21.05.2020 to 27.05.2020 along with the informant. Learned senior counsel submits that no such incident as alleged had taken place and in fact the informant in order to settle scores on account of her leaving Medica Super Speciality Hospital where she was working under the father-in-law of the petitioner the present criminal case has been instituted. Mr. Mazumdar, further submits that there has been a considerable delay in institution of the First Information Report as the occurrence is said to have taken place in the night of 27/28.05.2020 but the complaint was lodged on 28.05.2020 at about 8:00 P.M. While referring to the statement of the informant recorded u/s 164Cr.P.C., Mr. Mazumdar, further submits that on the face of it the same at best appears to be a case u/s 354Aof the Indian Penal Codewhich is bailable in nature. It has further been stated that the 164Cr.P.C. statement which was taken after two days of the alleged incident is an exaggerated-3-account on the part of the informant. It has been stated that the petitioner has remained in custody since 02.06.2020 and on the facts narrated above the petitioner deserves to be released on bail. 
 Mr. Shailesh Kumar Sinha, learned A.P.P. for the State has opposed the prayer for bail made by the petitioner. He has stated that the First Information Report as well as the 164Cr.P.C. statement of the victim would indicate that the petitioner was persistently making requests to stay the night with the informant. He has further submitted that the offence as alleged does not come within the purview ofSection 354Aof the Indian Penal Code since the petitioner had repeatedly made attempts at molesting the informant when she had come to the room allotted to the petitioner. 
 On consideration of the arguments advanced by the learned counsels for the petitioner as well as the learned A.P.P. for the State the First Information Report as well as the 164Cr.P.C. statement of the informant has been looked into. The 164Cr.P.C. statement basically is a reiteration of the written report submitted by the informant. It further appears from the said statement that details have been given regarding the duty which was allotted to the petitioner and the informant and the repeated insistence on the part of the petitioner to stay with the informant for the night on the excuse that it was not possible for the petitioner to go back to his residence. The various circumstances have been enumerated in the 164Cr.P.C. statement and lastly it has been stated at paragraph 11 of the said statement that when the informant progressed towards the door for going to her house the petitioner had caught her hand and tried to drag her thrice towards him and had also switched off the light. The petitioner has also been alleged to have pushed her towards the bed and had climbed upon her and when the informant started crying the grip of the petitioner loosened and the informant managed to escape and thereafter informed her seniors. She has further disclosed that the-4-petitioner had sent her a message on WhatsApp apologizing for such act on his part. 
 The gamut of the allegations levelled do not indicate an offence u/s 354Aof the Indian Penal Codeas has much been stressed upon by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner. The act of the petitioner was explicit as the petitioner had dragged the informant towards the bed and had climbed atop her but the informant somehow managed to escape from his clutches and the intention of the petitioner in the entire background facts and circumstances of the case as narrated by the informant does indicate an attempt made by the petitioner to commit rape upon the informant. 
 In such fact situation, therefore, I am not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner. The same is hereby rejected at this stage.

 PRESENT : 
 Heard Miss Amrita Vijay, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and Mr. Ashish Shekhar, the learned AC to SC(L&C)-II appearing for the respondent State. 
 
 2. This writ petition has been heard through Video Conferencing in view of the guidelines of the High Court taking into account the situation arising due to COVID-19 pandemic. None of the parties have complained about any technical snag of audio-video and with their consent this matter has been heard. 
 3. The petitioner has preferred this writ petition for quashing the order contained in Memo No.727 dated 04.02.2019 [Annexure-6] issued by the respondent no.2 whereby the petitioner has been inflicted punishment of withholding the petitioner's three consecutive pay increment with non-cumulative effect and also punishment of censure. 
 4. The case of the petitioner in this writ petition is that in the year 2008 the petitioner was Junior Engineer, working in Minor Irrigation Division, Godda under Water Resources Department, Jharkhand. The respondent no.3, the DC-cum-DPC entrusted 311 MGNREGA works to respondent no.5, the Executive Engineer and also released funds from contingency head of the MGNREGA scheme for purchase of agricultural tools and implements for distrubution amongst farmers/labourers for implementation of MGNREGA works. In the financial year 2008-09, the DC-cum-DPC released contintency funds to the Executive Engineer, M.I. Division, Godda in two trenches. Subsequently, the Executive Engineer, respondent no.5 advanced a sum of Rs.2,41,850/- to the petitioner. The petitioner purchased tools and implements from the open market and distrubuted amongst the farmers/labourers through their beneficiary committee. The petitioner submitted their accounts to the respondent no.5 Executive Engineer through Assistant Engineer, who in his turn passed the vouchers and3booked under the contingency head of MGNREGA funds from which advance had been released by the DC-cum-DPC. Thereafter the issue of Head of expenditure and violation of Rules 235 and 241 of the Bihar Finance Rule was raised by the respondent no.4 which culminated in the departmental enquiry. The enquiry report was submitted in which enquiry report rules out any financial loss or even temporary embezzlement as reflected in the enquiry report [Annexure-2] and the impugned order of punishment has been passed. 
 5. The case of the respondent-State is that the petitoner has purchased agricultural tools and implements it for various labour cooperation societies /committees of beneficiaries to the farmers under the scheme of MNREGA. As per the letter of Na tional level Monitor the tools and implements are to be s upplied to the labours free of cost and should be purchased through the material head but the then Executive Engineer allotted the amount to the Junior Engineers from contintency fund and there is no provision to purchase the tools and implements from the contingency fund. For the alleged irregularity in the MNREGA scheme and for the misappropriation of public fund by the petitioner during the posting at Minor Irrigation Subdivision, Godda, the Deputy Commissioner, Godda vide letter dated 21.08.2012 proposed prapatra ""ka"" for the departmenal proceeding. Accordingly, departmental proceeding was initiated against the petitioner under the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1930. The enquiry officer found him guilty of two charges and so far as other charges are concerned, he has been exonerated and submitted a report. The petitioner was asked to file reply to the second show cause, the second4show cause was not satisfactory. The petitioner was provided the fund in the year 2009 but he deposited the same in the year 2011 hence, a case of temporary embezzlement of money is made out against the petitioner and that is why the punishment order has been passed. 
 6. The learned counsel for the petitioner has assailed the impugned order on the ground that the petitioner has also deposited the amount in question, there is no question of any embezzlement, what to say about temporary embezzlement. She submitted that the funds were properly utilized for implementation of MGNREGA scheme. The respondent no.4 resorted to the pressure tactics and compelled the Junior Engineers to refund the sanctioned amount which was advanced to them by the Executive Engineer, respondent no.5. After more than a year, a departmental proceeding was initiated against the petitioner. She submitted that the amount in qustion has already been deposited, thus, there is no embezzlement. The enquiry officer finally submitted the enquiry report and he found that there is no case of embezzlement, but a case of procedural mistake on the part of the petitioner may be there. She further submitted that when the enquiry officer has already exonerated the petitioner, the respondent was bound to follow the procedure prescribed in the case of ""Punjab National Bank v. Kunj Bihari Mishra"" reported in (1998) 7 SCC 84. She further relied in the case of ""Md. Noorul Hoda v. The State of Jharkhand and Ors."" [W.P.(S) No.2201 of 2019] rendered by a coordinate Bench of this Court and submitted that the case of the petitioner is fully covered in the light of the judgment of a coordinate Bench. She further relied in the case of ""Satish Sharma v. The State of Jharkhand & Ors."" [W.P.(S) No.2357 of52019]. By way of referring to these two judegments, she further submitted that the case of the petitioner is fully covered in view of the coordinate Bench judgments (supra). 
 7. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent State submitted that the judgment relied by the learned counsel for the petitioner are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case. He further submitted that so far these two cases of coordinate Benches are concerned, are passed on the basis of Rule 43(b) of Jharkhand Pension Rules, whereas in the present case, the petitioner is workijng and in that view of the matter, that judgment are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case. He further submitted that there is financial embezzlement and that is why there is no illegality in the punishment order. 
 8. The Court has proceeded to examine the arguments advanced on behalf of the parties. The Court has perused the enquiry report wherein it is transpired that the enquiry officer has come to the conclusion that there is no case of embezzlement of Government fund is made out against the petitioner. However, the procedural lacuna has been indicated in the enquiry report by the petitioner. The cases relied by the learned counsel for the petitioner are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case as in those cases, the Hon'ble Bench has passed the order on the strength of Rule 43(b) of the Jharkhand Pension Rules as in that case the petitioner was a retired person and claiming for his pension and the said order was passed and in the present case, the petitioners are in servi ce thus, those cases are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case. So6far as the case rendered in the case of ""Punjab National Bank v. Kunj Bihari Mishra"" (supra) is concerned that is also not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case and there is no complete exoneration by the enquiry officer in view of other procedural part is concerned. The second show cause has also been issued to the petitioner and the petitioner has complied and after that the disciplinary authority has passed the order. It is well-settled provision of law that loss of confidence is primary factor, not the amount of money misappropriated. A temporary embezzlement is also a misconduct. Reference in this regard may be made in ""Diwanj Singh v. Life Insurance Corporation of India and Ors."" reported in (2015) 2 SCC 341. Paragraph no.8, 9 and 10 of the said judgment are quoted hereinbelow : 
 ""8. As far as argument relating to quantum of punishment, as modified by the High Court, which results in consequential forfeiture of pensionary benefits in view of Rule 23, quoted above, is concerned, we do not find the punishment to be harsh or disproportionate to the guilt, in view of the nature of the charge of which the appellant is found guilty in the present case. Time and again, this Court has consistently held that in such matters no sympathy should be shown by the courts. 
 9. In NEKRTC v. H. Amaresh, this Court, in para 18 of the judgment has expressed the views on this point as under: 
 ""18. In the instant case, the misappropriation of the funds by the delinquent employee was only Rs 360.95. This Court has considered the punishment that may be awarded to the delinquent employees who misappropriated the funds of the Corporation and the factors to be considered. This Court in a catena of judgments held that the loss of confidence is the primary factor and not the amount of money misappropriated and that the sympathy or generosity cannot be a factor which is impermissible in law. When an employee is found guilty of pilferage or of7misappropriating the Corporation's funds, there is nothing wrong in the Corporation losing confidence or faith in such an employee and awarding punishment of dismissal. In such cases, there is no place for generosity or misplaced sympathy on the part of the judicial forums and interfering therefore with the quantum of punishment."" 
 10.In Karnataka SRTC v. A.T. Mane4in which unaccounted amount was only Rs 93 this Court expressed its opinion in para 12 as under: (SCC p. 259) ""12. Coming to the question of quantum of punishment, one should bear in mind the fact that it is not the amount of money misappropriated that becomes a primary factor for awarding punishment; on the contrary, it is the loss of confidence which is the primary factor to be taken into consideration. In our opinion, when a person is found guilty of misappropriating the corporation's funds, there is nothing wrong in the corporation losing confidence or faith in such a person and awarding a punishment of dismissal."" 
 9. So far as the judgment relied by the learned counsel for the respondent in the case of ""State of Meghalaya v. Mecken Singh N. Marak"" reported in (2008) 7 SCC 580 is concerned, the Court is in agreement that the Court generally did not interfere underArticle 226of the Constitution of India if the punishment is on the well-founded basis, but in this case two punishments have been passed, which shocks the conscience of the Court. In view of settled legal proposition that the disciplinary authority on the basis of the magnitude of the misconduct is empowered to impose the punishment appropriate to the situation. The amount in question has already been deposited. 
 10. Thus the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner is not acceptable to the Court. The Court further finds that for such8punishment, the petitioner has been punished with two punishments i.e. Withholding of three consequtive pay increments with non- cumulative effect and also of censure, which shocks the conscience of the Court and on the quantum of punishment, the writ petition succeeds and accordingly, the impugned order dated 04.02.2019 is quashed. 
 11. The matter is remitted back to the respondent State to pass a fresh order in the light of the observation made in this judgment. 
 12. The writ petition [W.P.(S) No.5762 of 2019] stands allowed to the above extent and disposed of.

 The defect(s) as pointed out by the office is ignored for the present. Heard the counsel for the parties. 
 The petitioner is an accused for the offence punishable under Section(s) 341, 366A, 376 and 506of the Indian Penal Codeand Section 4 of the POCSO Act. 
 From the FIR, it is quite clear that there was love affair between the parties and on the assurance of marriage, physical relationship was established. A Panchayati was held, in which one week time was given to the petitioner for solemnizing marriage with the informant, but the petitioner and his father have not taken any steps. 
 Learned A.P.P opposes the prayer for bail of the petitioner. In view of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to release the petitioner on bail. Accordingly, the petitioner, above named, is directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/-(Rupees ten thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned Addl. Sessions Judge -cum- Special Judge, POCSO Act, Hazaribagh in connection with Barhi P.S. Case No. 35/2019. 
 I direct the Jail Authority that before releasing the petitioner from jail, the Jail Authority should get the petitioner tested for COVID-19. If the report is positive, then the District Administration will immediately take steps to isolate the petitioner and get him treated in COVID-19 Centre by following all the protocols.

 Earlier in this case notice was ordered to be issued to the opposite party no. 2 but neither the service report nor the A/D has yet returned. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner filed a supplementary affidavit from which it appears that the notice has been served through mail to the informant. However, in spite of the said facts none appears for the opposite party no. 2 (informant). 
 It has been alleged that the informant was seduced by a caller named Kaya Malhotra and on the inducement of giving sexual favour communication was established between the informant and Kaya Malthora and subsequent thereto an amount of Rs. 33,00,000/- was transferred to different accounts given by Kaya Malhotra and Dipti Singh. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has been made an accused being an associate of the main accused Amit Diwan who was the master mind behind such incident and in fact the matter between Amit Diwan and informant was compromised before the mediation centre and an amount of Rs. 38,00,000/- was returned to the informant. Learned counsel further submits that the petitioner is in custody since 24.06.2018. 
 Learned Spl. P.P. has opposed the prayer for bail of the petitioner and has submitted that the petitioner has got criminal antecedent which, however, has been denied by the counsel for the petitioner also stated that an inference has been drawn regarding the antecedent of the petitioner on the basis of the confessional statement rendered by the petitioner. 
 The aforesaid facts, therefore, indicate that the informant has returned back the amount pursuant to the compromise and main accused Amit Diwan has been granted bail by learned court below on 23.07.2019. The petitioner as stated above is already in custody since 24.06.2018. 
 Regard being had to the period of custody, the above named petitioner is directed to be released on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000 (ten thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Additional Judicial Commissioner-II, Ranchi, in connection with Cyber P.S.

 Order No.04 Date: 02.09.2020 This case is taken up through video conferencing. 
 The present writ petition has been filed for issuance of direction upon the respondents not to implement the notice dated 3 rd March, 2020 (Annexure-5 to the writ petition) issued under Section 13(4)(a) of the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets andEnforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (hereinafter to be referred as 'the Act, 2002') till disposal of S.A. No.29 of 2019, pending before the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Ranchi. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is guarantor of loan (cash credit facility) taken from the respondent no.3 (Dena Bank, Jamshedpur Branch) by the respondent no.4 in the year 2012. Subsequently, the said loan account became non-performing asset (NPA) on 31st January, 2018. Accordingly, a notice was issued by the respondent no.3 to the respondent no.4 underSection 13(2)of the Act, 2002 for payment of outstanding dues. Thereafter, a notice dated 28th September, 2018 for sale of immovable property of the petitioner was issued by the respondent no.3 under rules 8(6) and 9(1) of the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002 to the borrower- respondent no.4 as well as the petitioner being the guarantor. Aggrieved by the said notice, the petitioner preferred an application-2-before the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Ranchi underSection 17(1)of the Act, 2002, which was registered as S.A. No.29 of 2019. Since the date of institution of the said application before the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Ranchi, no effective step has been taken by the said Tribunal. In the meantime, a notice underSection 13(4)(a)of the Act, 2002 has been issued by the respondent no.3 on 3rd March, 2020 (Annexure-5 to the writ petition). Since S.A. No.29 of 2019 is not being taken up by the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Ranchi, the petitioner has been compelled to file the present writ petition. 
 Having heard learned counsel for the parties and considering the fact that the petitioner has already moved the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Ranchi by filing an application underSection 17(1)of the Act, 2002, which has also been registered as S.A. no.29 of 2019, without entering into the merit of the case, the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Ranchi is directed to expedite the hearing of the said case and to pass an appropriate order in accordance with law expeditiously. 
 The writ petition is, accordingly, disposed of with the aforesaid direction.

 This case is taken up through video conferencing. 
 The present writ petition has been filed for issuance of direction upon the respondent nos.2, 3 & 4 to make payment of compensation of Rs.26,96,263.92 with suitable interest in terms with award no.516 dated 9th September, 2017 issued in favour of the petitioner by the office of the respondent no.3 towards acquisition of the land along with residential house pertaining to plot no.3107/5, Khata no.77, situated at village Kulgo, Circle Dumri, District Giridih. Further prayer has been made for issuance of direction upon the respondent no.3 to take decision on the representation filed by the petitioner on 13 th November, 2019 as well as legal notices dated 7th September, 2019 and 23rd September, 2019 by which the petitioner has made request to make payment of the said amount to him in consequence of Award no.516 dated 9th September, 2017. 
 Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the contents of the writ petition. 
 The grievance of the petitioner is that despite preparation of the award in his favour, the compensation amount for acquisition of the aforesaid land for widening of N.H.2 has not been paid to him. On perusal of the petitioner's representation submitted before the-2-respondent no.3, it appears that one Ganga Rani, wife of Jodho Ram has filed an objection in relation to the said award, which, according to the petitioner, has been made without any basis only to delay the payment of compensation to the petitioner. 
 Considering the fact that there is a counter claim in relation to the award in question and the matter requires factual determination, the respondent no.3 (competent authority) is directed to take appropriate decision underSection 3H(3)of the National Highways Act, 1956 with regard to entitlement for receiving the compensation amount. The said determination shall be done by the said respondent within a period of three months from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this order. 
 This writ petition is, accordingly, disposed of.

 2. At the request of learned counsel for the petitioner, the defects as pointed out by the office, are ignored. 
 3. The present writ petition has been filed for quashing the order as contained in Memo No.1864/Revenue dated 25th July, 2020 (Annexure-9 to the writ petition) issued by the District Magistrate-cum-Deputy Commissioner, East Singhbhum, Jamshedpur (respondent no.3), so far as it relates to the petitioner-college by reasons of which a direction has been issued underSection 65of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, to take over the building as well as its campus along with all human resources, management-arrangements, furniture, lavatory premises, generator and all other available facilities at rental fare fixed by the Government for the purpose of using the same as COVID-19 isolation home and COVID Care Center for preventing the expansion of infection relating to the prevailing Corona (COVID-19) pandemic. 
 4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is a dental college and hospital in which prescribed course schedule has been provided by the University Grants Commission, Dental Council of India and a notice has been issued on 21st June, 2020 to undertake registration of MDS courses and PG Diploma courses in the current year. The regular academic session for the year 2020-21 has already commenced. The admission has been taken and the college is working in full capacity employing all its human resources (teaching and non-teaching). The-2-grievance of the petitioner is that the respondent no.3 while issuing the impugned order dated 25th July, 2020 exercising his power underSection 65of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and by adopting pick and choose method, the building with its campus, human resources, furniture, lavatory premises, generator and all other available facilities in the petitioner-college have been directed to be acquired from the date of use. Since the petitioner is undertaking all the academic activities in terms of the guidelines/advisory of Dental Council of India, the impugned order dated 25th July, 2020, so far as the same relates to the petitioner is arbitrary and discriminatory. The petitioner has already submitted its representation on 29th July, 2020 (Annexure-11 to the writ petition) before the respondent no.3 explaining its difficulties in detail. However, no decision has been taken by the said authority as yet.

Accordingly, the petitioner above named is directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned SDJM, Palamau in connection with Hussainabad Police Station Case No. 149 of 2018 (G.R.

Further condition that one of the bailers should be a close relative of the petitioner, having sufficient landed properties. 
 I direct the Jail Authority that before releasing the petitioner from jail, the Jail Authority should get the petitioner tested for COVID-19.

 Defects, as pointed out by the office, are ignored. Learned counsel for the petitioners at the outset seeks permission to withdraw this application so far as petitioner nos. 1, 4 and 5 are concerned. 
 Permission, as sought for, is granted. 
 This application is accordingly dismissed as withdrawn as regards the petitioner nos. 1, 4 and 5. 
 So far as petitioner nos. 2 and 3 are concerned, they apprehend their arrest in connection with Sahibganj (M) P.S. Case No. 249 of 2019. 
 It has been alleged that the accused persons had objected to the informant opening a shop besides their house. Consequent to the same, the informant and his parents were assaulted by the accused persons. 
 It appears that the wife of the petitioner no. 1 had lodged a case being Sahebganj M P.S. Case No. 248 of 2019, in which one person had died. Thus there seems to be a free fight between both the parties which has resulted in a case and counter case between them. The allegations are general and omnibus in nature. In such circumstances, therefore, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner nos. 2 and 3. 
 The petitioner nos. 2 and 3 named above, are therefore directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, they will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- ( Ten thousand only) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sahibganj in connection with Sahibganj (M) P.S. Case No. 249 of 2019, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel appearing for the State. 
 Defects as pointed out by the office are ignored. The petitioner is an accused in connection with Mahagama P.S. Case No. 01 of 2007 (S.T. No. 63B of 2008), registered for the offences punishable undersection 364,302,201,34of the Indian Penal Code and undersection 27of the Arms Act. 
 Vide order dated 31.07.2020, learned A.P.P. was directed to take instruction as to whether any inquiry has been conducted on the application submitted by the father of the petitioner that the petitioner is Vivekanand Jha and not Neelkanth Jha. Subsequent thereto an affidavit has been filed by the learned A.P.P. by which a report of the Deputy Superintendent of police has been brought on record in which a conclusion has been arrived at that Vivekanad Jha and Neelkanth Jha are the same person. However, this fact has been disputed by learned counsel for the petitioner by stating that all the documents including the educational certificates were handed over to the Deputy Superintendent of Police to substantiate the claim that Vivekanand Jha and Neelkanth Jha are different persons. But, the finding which has been recorded by the Deputy Superintendent of Police does not indicate that the said documents were considered. Further, the entire finding is based upon the police report. 
 Since it has been concluded that Vivekanand Jha and Neelkanth Jha are the same person, prima facie, this Court is satisfied with the report of the Deputy Superintendent of Police. So far as the allegations are concerned, it appears that the husband of the informant was taken away by the accused persons and he was shot at. It further appears that some of the accused persons have been convicted after conclusion of trial. 
 Regard being had to the nature of allegations leveled against the petitioner, I am not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner. 
 This application, accordingly, stands rejected. However, the trial may be expedited once the situation normalizes.

 The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with C.P. Case No. 21 of 2019. 
 The marriage of the complainant was solemnized with the petitioner on 30.05.2005. It has been alleged that after seven months, she was subjected to torture for bringing less dowry. Petitioner started residing with the complainant in a separate residence. It has also been alleged that the petitioner had solemnized a second marriage. 
 Most of the allegations levelled against the petitioner who happens to be the husband of the complainant are general and omnibus in nature. It further appears that the allegation of second marriage has been falsified in view of the fact that the cognizance has not been taken undersection 494of IPC.

 Heard learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and the learned counsel for the State, who opposes the prayer for bail of the petitioner. 
 The petitioner is an accused for allegedly committing offence punishable underSections 366A,376/34of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 4 & 8 of POCSO Act, in connection with Special POCSO Case No. 38 of 2020, arising out of Dumri P.S. Case No. 14 of 2020, pending in the court of Special Judge (POCSO ) Act, Giridih. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that there is delay of six days in lodging the FIR. He further submits that the parties have resolved their dispute and a petition has been filed by the victim, which suggests that she has requested not to proceed in this case any further. He further submits that no offence, at all, is made out. 
 I have gone through the FIR. In the FIR, victim has categorically stated that she has been ravished by the petitioner. The victim is minor. So far as the petition filed by the victim on the point of compromise and requesting not to proceed any further is concerned, the same primafacie amounts to tampering with the evidence. 
 Taking into consideration the aforesaid fact, I am not inclined to enlarge the petitioner on bail. Accordingly, his prayer for bail is hereby rejected.

 It has been alleged that the informant had gone to attend the marriage ceremony and at 10 pm when she had gone to ease herself the accused persons had forcibly taken her to the jungle and committed rape upon her. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners has stated that an improbable story has been created by the informant and in fact the informant was found in a compromising position with another person and since the petitioners had raised alarm they have been falsely implicated. Learned counsel further submits that the petitioner are from a different village and, therefore, it was not possible for the informant to have given the details of their name in the FIR. It has further been submitted that the FIR was instituted after 24 hours and even after the commission of rape she had come back but had never disclosed about the commission of rape immediately. Learned counsel has also stated that there is no medical report on record and it does not appear that the informant had suffered any external injuries. 
 Learned Spl.P.P. opposed the prayer for bail of the petitioners and has also referred to the impugned order which reveals about the lax attitude of hospital authorities in medically examining the victim. 
 On consideration of the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the respective parties it appears that the petitioners have been named in the FIR as the perpetrators of the offence in which a minor girl was subjected to gang rape by the petitioners. 
 Regard being had to the nature of allegations, I am not inclined to grant the bail to the petitioners. 
 This application, accordingly, stands rejected.

 The prayer for bail of the petitioner was earlier dismissed as withdrawn in A.B.A. No. 1998 of 2020. It has been alleged that he had demanded extortion money of Rs. 20,000/- from the informant. One Chaturgun Nayak, who had come to collect the extortion money, on behalf of the petitioner, was apprehended. The petitioner seems to have been implicated on the confession of Chaturgun Nayak.

 CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE APARESH KUMAR SINGH HON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE ANUBHA RAWAT CHOUDHARY Through Video Conferencing For the Petitioners : Mrs. Nitu Sinha, CGC For the Respondent : Mr. Rahul Kumar Das, Advocate 09/03.09.2020 Heard Mrs. Nitu Sinha, learned Central Government Counsel representing the petitioner Union of India and learned counsel Mr. Rahul Kumar Das representing the applicant / private respondent herein. 
 2. The learned Central Administrative Tribunal, Patna Bench at Ranchi after considering the rival stand of the parties passed the order at Annexure-3 dated 29.03.2012 in O.A. No. 237 of 2010 which reads as under: 
 ""In the instant OA the applicant has sought for benefit of judgment rendered by CAT, Principal Bench in OA No. 804 of 1998,Hari Ram Shukla and others vs. Union of India & Othersand OA No. 2634 of 2004,Phool Chand vs. Union of India & Othersdecided by the Principal Bench on 14.07.2005. 
 The point for consideration is whether the applicant is similarly situated to the applicants of OA 804 of 1998 and OA 2634 of 2004 and whether he is entitled to the same benefits. 
 2. It is also noticed that the impugned order dated 21.10.2010 [Annexure- A/8] is in reply to the application dated 08.09.2010 which reads as follows: ""It is intimated by HQCEJZ, Jabalpur vide their letter No. 110 1/ACP/211/FIB dated 09th August, 2010 that only the affected applicant of the OA No. 804/1998 are eligible in the skilled grade pay merely sympathy only. This is not as existing policy applicable to all C/Man [Blind]. Hence, your application dated 08th September, 2010 and certificates are returned herewith."" 
 It is noticed that on 08.09.2010[Annexure-A/7], the applicant in OA No. 237 of 2010 had prayed before the Chief Engineer, Central Command, Lucknow as follows: 
 ""1. That Sir, Engineer-in-Chief Branch had issued a letter No. 9523/438/Policy/EIC [legal-D] dated 15th Jul. 2008 [Copy enclosed] for2the totally visually handicapped [Blind] C/Man to upgrade them from semi skilled to skilled based on the decision of Supreme Court but it is regretted that the said order has not so far been implemented by Garrison Engineer Ranchi. 
 2. That Sir, I have been approaching to the authorities since long to take proper action for my up-gradation and fixation of my pay scale of skilled category but unfortunately, no action has been taken in this regard. 
 3. I have come to know that all the visually [Blind] handicapped C/Men serving under other Commands have already been upgraded from semi skilled to skilled on account of the above mentioned letter and they are getting the skilled pay wherever I have not been considered for the same so far. Therefore, I request your honour to be kind enough to issue necessary direction in this regard for lower formation to implement the said order and to consider my up-gradation. 
 In this regard, the following certificates are submitted herewith for your verification and necessary action please: 
 [a] Certificate issued by Govt. of India, Department of Social Welfare, Training centre for the Adult Blind, Rajpur Road Dehradun. 
 [b] Certificate issued by ""The Pheroze and Noshir Merewanji Re- habitation Centre for Blind, East View, Mount Abu, Ranjasthan."" 
 3. It also appears from the communication dated 15.07.2008 [Annexure- A/4] the opinion of the Director [Legal] is expressed in the following words: 
 ""It may be noted that Caneman who is not visually handicapped is not entitled to skilled grade of pay being not similarly situated to other visually handicapped Canemen. If any of Caneman [not visually handicapped] serving under your control, files an OA/CWP seeking skilled grade, strength from the above judgment dated 09th April, 2008 be extracted for defending such case in the Govt. interest."" 
 In the written statement the respondent have stated as follows: 
 4. The applicant had applied for pay scale of skilled category being a visually (Blind) handicapped. His case was forwarded to HQ CWE Ranchi vide our letter no. 1648/46/EIA[B] dated 16th June, 2010. Further HQ CWE Ranchi forwarded his application to HQ CE JZ Jabalpur vide tyheir letter no. 10588/ACPS/1708/EIC [2] dated 26th June, 2010. HQ CE JZ Jabalpur further asked to forward certain documents/policy letter from HQ CWE Ranchi with copy to this office. Further this office submitted required documents/papers to HQ CWE Ranchi vide our letter no. 1648/56/EIA [B] dated 21st August, 2010 and HQ CWE Ranchi forwarded copy of HQ CE JZ Jabalpur letter no. 11071/ACP/211/EIB dated 09 August, 2010 vide their letter no. 10588/ACP/1721/EIC[2] dated 20th September, 2010. As per E-in-C's Br. Letter dated 15th July, 2008 mentioned in HQ CE JZ Jabalpur individual is not entitled for ACP of skilled Cat. The policy/instruction received from higher Hqr. Has been communicated to the individual through BSO vide letter No. 1027/ACP/23/EIA dated 28th September, 2010. 
 5. It is not the case of the respondents that the benefit of OA 804 of 1998 or OA 2634 of 2004 was directed not to be a precedent for other similarly situated Caneman or it was especially restricted to the applicants therein. It is also not their submission that the aforesaid judgments/orders were set aside or modified higher up. It is also not in dispute that the applicants are visually handicapped Caneman. Thus, in view of the reliefs granted to the visually handicapped Caneman under the Ministry of Defence by coordinate Benches, in OA No. 2034 of 2004 and OA No. 804 of 1998 the applicants are entitled to the same benefits as given to such applicants. 
 6. The impugned order dated 21st October, 2010 [Annexure-A/8] tends to create a class within a class and a macro compartmentalization on the basis of a micro distinction, which is bad in law. Even on the principle of equal pay for equal work, the applicant deserves consideration. As such, the impugned order being bereft of reasons is quashed. 
 7. The respondents are directed to grant the same benefits to the applicant as granted to their counterparts in OA No. 804 of 1998 and OA 2634 of 2004 with consequential benefits of proforma fixation if otherwise found eligible. However, actual benefits granted from the date of this order. 
 8. The OA is accordingly disposed of with no order as to costs."" 
 This order was not challenged by the applicant/ respondent before the High Court underArticle 226of the Constitution of India, instead he preferred a review application being R.A. No. 04 of 2012 with the plea that the learned Tribunal did not confer him the benefit of pay scale of skilled grade from the initial date of joining in terms of the order passed in O.A. No. 3998 of 2010 by the learned CAT, Principal Bench, Delhi. Three grounds were pleaded by the applicant before the learned Tribunal which are: 
 a) that the order passed by the Hon'ble Tribunal had not taken into consideration the order passed in O.A. No. 3998/2010 dated 11.10.2011 passed by learned CAT, Principal Bench, New Delhi. 
 b) that the learned Tribunal has not taken into consideration the fact that similarly situated persons have been granted the skilled grade from the date of their joining in service. 
 c) That earned Tribunal has failed to fix a time frame for compliance of the order. 
 3. The instant writ petition arises out of the order dated 31.12.2012 passed in R.A. No. 04 of 2012, whereunder the learned CAT has modified the original order granting benefit of the pay scale of skilled grade to the applicant from the date of initial engagement with consequential benefits to be paid within 4 months. The review order (Annexure-5) reads as under: 
 ""The review of the order dated 29.03.2012 in OA No. 237 of 2010[R] is sought for on the ground as follows: 
 That Hon'ble Tribunal vide order dated 29.03.2012 allowed the application of the applicant directing the respondents to grant the same benefit to the applicant as has been given to his counterparts in OA No. 804 of 1998 and OA No. 2634 of 2004. However, Hon'ble Tribunal did not conferred the benefit to the applicant from the date of his joining in terms of the order passed in OA No. 3998 of 2010 by the Central Administrative Tribunal , Principal Bench, New Delhi. Further, the order do not specify the4time frame in which the order passed by the Hon'ble Tribunal is to be complied with. 
 2. As I go through the orders in OA 804 of 1998 and OA 2634 of 2004, I find that the orders have been passed granting benefits from the date of initial engagement. 
 3. I also find that in a similar matter being OA No. 1832/2007 decided on 17.03.2008 and OA No.2697 of 2003 decided on 05.05.2004, the benefits have been granted from the date of initial engagement. 
 4. Hence, in the interest of justice and to mete out the invidious discrimination amongst the peers in the same post, the order is modified to the extent that the benefits of pay scale of skilled grade shall be granted to the applicant from the date of initial engagement to the post of Caneman with consequential benefits within four months from the date of communication of this order."" 
 4. In the Original Application underSection 19of the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985 at Annexure-1 to the writ petition, the applicant pleaded that he being blind man appointed on the post of Cane weaver on 11.03.1985 which required a minimum qualification of Matriculation. He was however a Graduate but was treated under Semi Skilled category. He referred to the order passed in O.A. No. 804 of 1998 preferred by 20 visually handicapped Canemen (Annexure-3 to the OA) and also relied upon the notification dated 15.07.2008 of the Ministry of Defence (Annexure-4 to OA) in support of his submission that visually handicapped Canemen were granted scale of Skilled Grade. Though he made reference to the order passed in O.A. No. 13 of 2007 but the said order was not enclosed instead a letter dated 19.10.2010 of the Ministry of Defence(Army) was enclosed as Annexure-5 to the OA. The order passed in O.A. No. 2634 of 2004 also was not enclosed to the O.A. Learned Tribunal after consider the case of the parties chose to grant relief to the applicant on similar line as in O.A. No. 804 of 1998 and O.A. No. 2634 of 2004. The order passed in O.A. No. 804 of 1998 has been placed before us by the learned counsel for the Union of India but it does not disclose that relief was granted from the initial date of joining. The order passed in O.A. No. 2634 of 2004 has neither been placed on record before the learned Tribunal in the applicant's Original Appliction nor in the review application as it appear from the pleadings of the review application enclosed as Annexure-4. It has not been annexed to the present writ petition. 
 5. A perusal of the order passed in review shows that the learned Tribunal was guided by an order passed in O.A. No. 3998 of 2010, which conferred5the benefit to the said applicant from the date of joining. It appears further from para 2 of the impugned order that the learned Tribunal erroneously recorded that in O.A. No. 804 of 1998 relief was granted from the date of initial engagement to the applicants. It is being noticed that the order passed in O.A. No. 2634 of 2004 is not there anywhere in the pleadings before the learned CAT or before us. Learned Tribunal further went on to rely upon the order passed in 1832 of 2007 dated 17.03.2010 and O.A. No. 2697 of 2008 dated 5.05.2004 where, as per the Tribunal the benefits were granted from the date of initial engagement. These orders were also not on record before the learned Tribunal and are not before this court as it appears from the pleadings on record in the writ petition. However, inspite of the fact the applicant did not produce these orders at the time of decision of the original application nor pleaded that they could not be discovered with ordinary diligence when the original application was being decided, learned Tribunal in exercise of review jurisdiction proceeded to extend the relief granted in the original application. 
 6. The case has essentially been argued on the scope of review by the Union of India. Mrs. Nitu Sinha, learned Central Government Counsel has referred to the decision of the Hon'ble Jammu & Kashmir High Court at Srinagar in SWP No. 1698 of 2012 dated 18.10.2012 (part of Annexure- 
 7). She has pointed out to the findings of the Learned Court, specifically at para 5 and 6 where despite such claim, relief was restricted to a period of 18 months preceding the date of filing of the original application to the applicant / respondent therein seeking the pay scale of skilled Grade being in visually handicapped semiskilled cadre of Canemen. This order has been upheld by the Apex Court in Special Leave to Appeal (C) No. 24521 of 2013, judgement dated 14.08.2014 where under the applicant's challenge was dismissed in limine. Learned counsel for the Union of India submits that the learned Tribunal fell in grave error in expanding this relief despite the fact that there was no error apparent on the face of record in the order passed in original application. The power of review is a creature of statute. Learned CAT has been conferred that power underSection 22(3(f) of theAdministrative Tribunal Act, 1985, but the principle that guide the exercise of such power are ingrained in order 47 of the Civil Procedure Code as rendered in decisions of the Apex Court. In such circumstances, the impugned order deserves to be set aside. 
 7. Learned counsel for the applicant/ respondent herein has stoutly defended the direction of the learned Tribunal in granting relief from the initial date of joining and specifying the period within which it is to be paid. Learned counsel for the applicant has taken us to the pleadings of the original application, which we have referred to herein above and submitted that the learned Tribunal committed an error in passing the order in original application despite a prayer to that effect and averments in the pleadings also. As such, these orders which have been relied upon by the learned Tribunal in the review order were passed in the case of similarly situated visually handicapped Canemen in semi-skilled category. Therefore, on the principle of parity, identical relief has been granted in the review. The Union of India has not come out clear on the point that other similarly situated persons have been granted the scale of skilled category of Canemen from the initial date of joining. The applicant being a blind persons should not be denied relief. As such the impugned order does not deserve any interference of this Court on the principle of parity. There is no error or lack of jurisdiction in the order passed by the Learned CAT. 
 8. We have considered the submission of learned counsel for the parties and taken into account the relevant material pleaded on record. The instant challenge is to an order passed in review jurisdiction by the learned CAT. The principles governing the exercise of review jurisdiction are contained in Order 47 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code which are as under: 
 ""1. Application for review of judgment.- (1) Any person considering himself aggrieved - 
 (a) by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred. 
 (b) by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed, or 
 (c) by a decision on a reference from a Court of Small Causes, and who, from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree passed or order made against him, may apply for a review of judgment to the Court which passed the decree or made the order. (2) A party who is not appealing from a decree or order may apply for a review of judgment notwithstanding the pendency of an appeal by some other party except where the ground of such appeal is common to the applicant and the appellant, or when, being respondent, he can present to the Appellate Court the case on which he applies for the review."" [Explanation--The fact that the decision on a question of law on which the judgement of the court is based has been reversed or modified by the7subsequent decision of a superior court in any other case, shall not be a ground for the review of such judgement] 
 9. The legal principle as to the scope of exercise of review jurisdiction have been well settled in the decisions of the Apex Court from time to time. [See State of West Bengal & others Vrs Kamal Sengupta & another ; (2008) 8 SCC 612 para 35]. It is apparent from the discussion made above by reference to the pleadings on record and a comparison of the order passed by learned CAT in the Original Application No. 237 of 2010 and the review application being R.A. No. 04/2012, that learned Tribunal at the stage of review chose to rely upon orders passed in certain original applications, which were not pleaded or placed on record before the learned Tribunal while deciding the original application. These orders have also not been placed before this Court in the present matter. It further appears that the applicant has not either pleaded that these orders were not within his knowledge or could not have been produced despite due diligence when the original application was decided. On the other hand, it appears that there is a variance in the approach of different Courts in granting consequential relief to employees belonging to semi-skilled Canemen category and visually handicapped. The Union of India has placed the order passed by the Hon'ble Jammu & Kashmir High Court where the relief was limited to a period of 18 months prior to the date of filing of the original sapplication. The pleadings on record and the orders passed by the learned CAT do not throw any light as to why the relief has been molded by granting him the scale of semi-skilled category from the date of initial joining. Consequential relief in individual cases are granted on the basis of the facts of the case and taking into account relevant factors such as delay in approaching the court in seeking relief. 
 10. Having regard to the discussion made herein above and for the reasons recorded, we are of the considered view that the impugned order expanding relief to the applicant was beyond the scope of review. The applicant has neither been able to make out the case of an error apparent on the face of record nor could show that the orders relied upon by the applicant at the stage of review could not be produced despite exercising due diligence when the original application was decided. It has been pointed out by learned counsel for the Union of India that the respondents were not granted any opportunity to file rejoinder to the review8application. We have consciously refrained from observing anything on the merits of the claim of the applicant for arrears of pay from the initial date of joining since the impugned order is found to be unsustainable only on the ground that it was beyond the scope of review jurisdiction of the Learned Tribunal. It further appears that the decisions cited by the parties of different Courts or the Tribunals on the point of grant of scale of pay in the skilled category from the initial date of joining are both ways depending upon the facts and circumstances of such case. 
 11. As such, the impugned order cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. According the order dated 31.12.2012 passed in R.A. No. 04/2012 by the learned Central Administrative Tribunal, Patna Bench at Ranchi is set aside. The writ petition stands allowed. Pending I.A.s are closed.

 Heard learned counsel for the parties through V.C. 
 2. The instant writ application was initially preferred for a direction upon the respondent-authorities to pay the arrears of salary to the petitioner since June, 2001. During pendency of this application, the petitioner has been discharged from service pursuant to the office order as contained in Memo No. 683 dated 12.05.2014 (Annexure-12); as such, the aforesaid order has been impugned pursuant to the filing of amendment writ application which was allowed by this Court. 
 3. This case has a chequered history. The petitioner was a land looser and displaced person in Swranrekha Project and vide memo No. 19437 dated 26.05.1987, the Development Book has been issued by the Rehabilitation Officer,2Swranrekha Project, Chandil and subsequently, the name of the petitioner has been incorporated, being a son of the land looser and he was appointed as typist vide order dated 22.04.1992. The said appointment was pursuant to a decision taken by the Coordinate Committee and the petitioner was posted as typist on a sanctioned and vacant post at Special Land Acquisition Office No.3, Chaliyama. The service of the petitioner has been extended from time to time. Thereafter, vide Memo No. 45 dated 30.04.1994, the Special Land Acquisition Officer requested the Additional Director, Rehabilitation and Land Acquisition to appoint the petitioner on regular post. 
 The case of the petitioner is that since he was not getting his regular salary since June, 2001, he filed a representation before the Special Land Acquisition Officer for payment of arrears of salary. As a matter of fact, the Special Land Acquisition Officer, Swranrekha Project, Chandil vide Memo No. 113 dated 14.05.2004 wrote a letter to the Additional Director regarding payment of arrear of salary of the petitioner, but unfortunately, the same has not been paid. Even the under Secretary of the Department vide Memo No. 3092 dated 22.11.2008, has directed to Chief Engineer regarding taking proper action in the case of the petitioner. 
 From record it also appears that in the year 2007, vide Memo No.3543 dated 31.12.2007, a chart was prepared by the Government and the persons who were continuously3working for more than 10 years were directed to be transferred and pursuant to the said order dated 31.12.2007, the petitioner was transferred to the office of Special Land Acquisition officer, Irrigation project, Ranchi. It is also a fact that the petitioner was deputed as 1st Polling Officer during General Parliamentary Election, 2009 being Typist of Land Acquisition Officer, Chandil. Even the attendance register has been annexed as Annexure-8 to the writ application. However, since the petitioner was not being paid salary regularly; as such, he represented the Secretary, Department of Water Resources on 11.09.2009 for payment of arrear of salary since June, 2001, but no action has been taken by the respondent authorities. 
 Faced with the situation, the petitioner filed the instant writ application in the year 2009, for payment of salary since 2001. However, during pendency of this case, by office order as contained in Memo No. 683 dated 12.05.2014, the Deputy Secretary, Department of Water Resources, Government of Jharkhand relieved the petitioner from services without issuing any show cause notice and without following the principal of natural justice. Thus, on the one hand, the petitioner was not being paid salary regularly and on the other hand, instead of paying salary to the petitioner, the order of termination was issued which has been made impugned by way of amendment in the instant writ application by the order of this Hon'ble Court.4 
 4. A counter-affidavit has been filed in this case, wherein it has been stated inter-alia that the petitioner had joined the office of Special Land Acquisition Officer (SLAO in short), Chandil on 21.05.1997 on the basis of the letter No. 162 dated 20.05.1997 SLAO, Chaliyama. At the time of joining, petitioner submitted only last pay certificate and he did not submit his service book from his earlier posting in Chaliyama Office. The petitioner had received his salary from date of his joining till the audit party from A.G. objected on the payment of salary of the petitioner in the month of August, 2001. The audit party raised objection and gave direction to stop payment of salary to petitioner as the petitioner had not submitted his service book till the date of audit. The service book was thereafter, submitted on 7.05.2008 by the SLAO, Adityapur. On perusal of the service book, it was revealed that the appointment of the petitioner was only for 3 months and this fact was entered in the service book and also a photocopy of the appointment letter issued on 24.04.1992 was annexed with the service book. It has also been stated that the SLAO, Chandil had written several times to the higher authority for extension of the service of the petitioner. Lastly, as per the order vide letter No. 683 dated 12.05.2014, the petitioner was terminated and discharged from service with immediate effect. The said order was communicated to the petitioner vide office Memo No. 197 dated 25.06.2014. According to the order, the service of the petitioner was illegal, so, no question arise to5make payment of due salary. 
 5. At the outset, learned counsel for the petitioner confines his argument only on the question of payment of salary and submits that by reading Annexure-G to the counter-affidavit filed on 06.07.2020, it clearly transpires that as per the report which was the internal communication among the respondents clearly indicates that Rs.9,00,000/- (Rs. 9 laks) was pending till that date and the same was not paid to him. He further submits that Annexure-H to the said counter-affidavit also indicates that a letter was written by Special Land Acquisition Officer to the Chief Engineer requesting for payment of arrear of salary to the petitioner. He vehemently contended that on the one hand the respondent authorities themselves are admitting that this petitioner is not being paid salary and only till 2009, the arrears of salary was about Rs. 9 lacs which is apparent from the record of the respondents and on the other hand, instead of payment of arrears of salary, the respondent has issued the impugned letter of termination (Annexure-12), whereby it has been stated that the appointment of the petitioner was not legal as there was difference in the date of birth as provided by the petitioner with that of the entry made in the service book and secondly the petitioner being a differently able person for only 20% and he is knowing only manual typing; as such, his services has been terminated and he has been discharged with immediate effect. 
 
 6. Learned counsel for the petitioner further contended that, admittedly, the petitioner had worked till the age of termination and as such, he is entitled for his salary. Even the termination order is illegal and arbitrary as the same has been passed pursuant to filing of this writ application and that too without giving any show cause notice to the petitioner; as such, the same is illegal and deserves to be quashed and set aside and the respondent authorities be directed to pay the salary of the petitioner till the date of termination. 
 7. Learned counsel for the respondent submits that the petitioner has received his salary from the date of his joining in the year 1992 till 2001 when the audit party from Accountant Office objected on payment of salary of the petitioner in the month of August, 2001. The audit party has raised the objection on the ground that the petitioner had not submitted his service book till the date of audit. It has been further submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that the service book was submitted only on 07.05.2008 by the Special Land Acquisition Officer, Adityapur and from perusal of the service book it was revealed that the service of the petitioner was only for three months which fact was also entered in the service book and a photocopy of the appointment letter was annexed with the service book. On all these grounds, the services of the petitioner was terminated vide order dated 25.06.2014. 
 
 8. Learned counsel for the respondents relied upon the judgments passed in the case of Basistha Narayan Singh Vs. State of Jharkhand reported in 2014 SCC Online Jhar.11, Umesh Kumar Singh Vs. State of Bihar & Ors. reported in 2001 (3) L.L.N. 374 and also the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Madhya Pradesh Hasta Shilpa Vikas Nigam Ltd. Vs. Devendr Kumar Jain & Ors. reported in (1995) 1 SCC 638. Relying upon the aforesaid judgments, learned counsel for the respondents contended that since the initial appointment of the petitioner itself was void ab initio; as such, he is not entitled for any salary. 
 9. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and after going through the materials available on record, it appears that the petitioner has received his salary from the date of his appointment in the year 1992 till August, 2001 regularly. His salary was stopped only when there was an audit objection on the ground that the service book of the petitioner was not available. It is also an admitted fact that the service book was made available only on 07.05.2008 (after a lapse of about 7 years), when it was revealed that the petitioner was initially appointed for three months only. 
 It further transpires from Annexure-G & H of the counter affidavit and various other documents filed by the respondent-State that the petitioner continued to work under the respondent-authorities, but had not received regular8salary inasmuch as, the report dated 14.12.2009 given by the Special Land Acquisition Officer, Swranrekha Project, Chandil to the under Secretary, Water Resources Department mentioning therein that an amount of Rs. 9 lakh approx was due as against the salary of the petitioner. 
 The record further reveals that the petitioner was also transferred in the year, 2007 to the office of the Special Land Acquisition Officer, Irrigation Project, Ranchi, pursuant to the decision of the government as contained in Memo No.3543 dated 31.12.2007, whereby a chart was prepared by the Government regarding the persons who were continuously working for more than 10 years were directed to be transferred and since the petitioner completed 10 years of service at one place he was also transferred in the year, 2007 to the office of the Special Land Acquisition Officer, Irrigation Project, Ranchi. 
 In these background, there would not be any exaggeration in holding that the petitioner was working regularly under the respondents. There are number of documents which have been filed by the respondents clearly transpires that the petitioner had worked at least till 2009. It is amazing that when the respondent-authorities came to know about the fact that the petitioner's initial appointment was only for three months in 2007, they took 7 years in issuing the order of termination and that too on other grounds. In this background, I am forced to agree with the9contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that it is only after filing of the writ application, the respondent authorities instead of paying the salary to the petitioner, terminated his services. 
 I am not in an agreement with the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents that since the initial appointment itself was illegal, the petitioner is not entitled for any salary. In this regard, I want to hold that this is not a case of illegal appointment. The petitioner was appointed pursuant to the order dated 22.04.1992 (Annexure-2), wherein it was specifically stated that the initial appointment of the petitioner was for three months and if within three months the work will not be found satisfactory, his services will be deemed to have terminated automatically. At the cost of repetition, the petitioner's services was not terminated rather he continued to serve the respondent-department at various places inasmuch as, vide Memo No. 45 dated 30.04.1994, the Special Land Acquisition Officer, Chandil requested the Additional Director, Rehabilitation and Land Acquisition to appoint the petitioner on regular post. Further, the petitioner was also transferred vide Annexure-6 along with several persons on the ground that they have completed 10 years of service at one place and the name of the petitioner was mentioned in that list. 
 The judgments cited by learned counsel for the respondents is with regard to those cases in which the10employee was appointed illegally inasmuch as, in the case of Basistha Narayan Singh (Supra) the appointment of the petitioner was held to be illegal because there was no vacancy advertised nor there was any sanction committee constituted and in the case of Umesh Kumar Singh (Supra) the appointment letter was forged. So far as the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Madhya Pradesh Hasta Shilpa Vikas Nigam Ltd. Vs. Devendr Kumar Jain & Ors (Supra) is concerned, it is also not applicable as in that case the issue was with respect of complying with the formalities as enshrined underArticle 311of Constitution of India. 
 In the case in hand, the appointment letter was neither forged nor fabricated rather the petitioner being a land looser and displaced person in Swranrekha Project, his name was incorporated in the Development Book issued by the Rehabilitation Officer, Swranrekha Project, Chandil and subsequently, he was appointed as typist vide order dated 22.04.1992 on the vacant post pursuant to a decision taken by the Coordinate Committee and he was posted as typist at Special Land Acquisition Office No.3, Chaliyama. In the appointment letter it was very clear that the petitioner was appointed initially for three months with a condition that if his work will not improve within three months; his service will be terminated automatically. The record also transpires that vide Memo No. 45 dated 30.04.1994, the Special Land11Acquisition Officer requested the Additional Director, Rehabilitation and Land Acquisition to appoint the petitioner on regular post. The fact further reveals that the petitioner was also transferred vide Annexure-6 along with several persons on the ground that they have completed 10 years of service at one place. As such, there are several evidences which transpire that the respondent authorities have taken work from the petitioner regularly without payment of regular salary inasmuch as, in the year, 2009, a report was submitted that Rs.9 laks was due as the salary of the petitioner. In the case of Rajendra Mohan Bhatnagar as reported in 1992 Supp (2) SCC 513 wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that when the petitioner has in all put in more than 15 years of service and holding that such an officer was not a permanent employee and remained only as temporary employee is as abuse of service jurisprudence. Para-2 of the said judgment is quoted herein below. 
 ""2. We have examined the material. We are unable to accept the decision of the High Court. The appellant was initially taken in the government service in 1958. In 1962 when the Corporation was formed, he was taken by the Corporation. While in the service of the Corporation, the appellant was promoted at least on three occasions and the last promotion was in 1973 as Chief Personnel Officer (Head of Personnel Department). He has in all put in more than 15 years of service. To say that such an officer was not a permanent employee and remained only as a temporary employee is an abuse of the service jurisprudence. The Corporation ought not to have invoked the provisions of Regulation 69 to terminate the services of the appellant on the ground that he was temporary servant."" 
 . 
 10. In view of the aforesaid discussions I hold that the petitioner is entitled for entire salary till the date of12termination inasmuch as, the respondents continued to take work from him for more than 15 year. At this stage, it is pertinent to refer the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court passed in the case of State of Punjab & Others versus Jagjit Singh & Others reported in (2017) 1 SCC 148 wherein the Hon'ble Court has held that the principle of equal pay for equal work has also been extended to temporary employees. Para 57, 58 & 59 is quoted herein below:- 
 ""57. There is no room for any doubt that the principle of ""equal pay for equal work"" has emerged from an interpretation of different provisions of the Constitution. The principle has been expounded through a large number of judgments rendered by this Court, and constitutes law declared by this Court. The same is binding on all the courts in India underArticle 141of the Constitution of India. The parameters of the principle have been summarised by us in para 42 hereinabove. The principle of ""equal pay for equal work"" has also been extended to temporary employees (differently described as work-charge, daily wage, casual, ad hoc, contractual, and the like). The legal position, relating to temporary employees has been summarised by us, in para 44 hereinabove. The above legal position which has been repeatedly declared, is being reiterated by us yet again. 
 58. In our considered view, it is fallacious to determine artificial parameters to deny fruits of labour. An employee engaged for the same work cannot be paid less than another who performs the same duties and responsibilities. Certainly not, in a welfare State. Such an action besides being demeaning, strikes at the very foundation of human dignity. Anyone, who is compelled to work at a lesser wage does not do so voluntarily. He does so to provide food and shelter to his family, at the cost of his self-respect and dignity, at the cost of his self-worth, and at the cost of his integrity. For he knows that his dependants would suffer immensely, if he does not accept the lesser wage. Any act of paying less wages as compared to others similarly situate constitutes an act of exploitative enslavement, emerging out of a domineering position. Undoubtedly, the action is oppressive, suppressive and coercive, as it compels involuntary subjugation. 
 59. We would also like to extract hereinArticle 7of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1966. The same is reproduced below: 
 ""7. The States Parties to the present Covenant recognise the13right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work which ensure, in particular: 
 (a) Remuneration which provides all workers, as a minimum, with: 
 (i) Fair wages and equal remuneration for work of equal value without distinction of any kind, in particular women being guaranteed conditions of work not inferior to those enjoyed by men, with equal pay for equal work; 
 (ii) A decent living for themselves and their families in accordance with the provisions of the present Covenant; 
 (b) Safe and healthy working conditions; 
 (c) Equal opportunity for everyone to be promoted in his employment to an appropriate higher level, subject to no considerations other than those of seniority and competence; 
 (d) Rest, leisure and reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay, as well as remuneration for public holidays."" (emphasis supplied) India is a signatory to the above Covenant having ratified the same on 10-4-1979. There is no escape from the above obligation in view of different provisions of the Constitution referred to above, and in view of the law declared by this Court underArticle 141of the Constitution of India, the principle of ""equal pay for equal work"" constitutes a clear and unambiguous right and is vested in every employee--whether engaged on regular or temporary basis."" 
 11. Since the petitioner has confined his argument only on the claim for payment of his salary; as such, I am not dealing with the legality or illegality of the termination order, but certainly since the petitioner has worked till the date of termination, he is entitled for his entire salary calculated in the light of judgment of Jagjit Singh (Supra). 
 12. As a result, this writ application is allowed to the aforesaid extent and disposed of with above observation and directions.

 Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner undertakes to deposit the deficit court fee within two weeks from today. Rest of the defects stand ignored for the present. 
 Heard the parties. 
 Petitioner, in this application, has prayed to quash the order dated 26.07.2010, whereby process underSection 82Cr.P.C. has been issued against the petitioner. The petitioner also challenged the order dated 18.09.2010, by which attachment order has been issued against him in terms of Section 83 Cr.P.C. 
 Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that both the orders are absolutely cryptic and non-speaking and do not reflect any subjective satisfaction which is required to be reflected in the order sheets. He further submits that as the petitioner was not even aware about the proceeding, so he could not appear before the court nor he could file an appropriate application before the court earlier. Thus, the same need to be quashed. 
 After hearing the counsel for the parties and on going through the impugned order dated 26.07.2010, I find that without recording any subjective satisfaction, the court issued process underSection 82Cr. P.C. The order is cryptic and non-speaking. Same was the situation when the order dated 18.09.2010 was passed. No subjective satisfaction has been recorded by the Court below as required in terms ofSection 83Cr.P.C. Thus in absence of any reason and satisfaction, the orders impugned are rendered bad in law. 
 Thus, I am inclined to allow this criminal miscellaneous petition. Accordingly, the same is hereby allowed. The impugned orders dated 26.07.2010 & 18.09.2010, by which processes underSections 82&83of-2-the Codeof Criminal Procedure have been issued, are hereby set aside. The matter is remitted to the court below to pass a fresh order in accordance with law. 
 This criminal miscellaneous petition stands allowed.

 05/03.09.2020 Defect(s) as pointed out by the office is ignored. Heard learned counsel for the parties through video conferencing. They have no complain with respect to the audio and video clarity and quality. 
 In this application, petitioner has challenged the order taking cognizance dated 9.8.2019 by which cognizance of offence underSection 138of NI Act has been taken against the petitioner and thereafter summons have been issued. 
 Counsel for the petitioner submits that there was no legal dues as such the cognizance of offence is absolutely bad. He submits that in fact no material was supplied as per the agreement,that is the reason the petitioner has stopped payment. Since the material was not supplied, there was no question of any payment sosection 138NI Act will not be attracted. 
 I have gone through the complaint petition itself. In the complaint petition it has been alleged that the materials i.e LPG, Gas stove, Hosepipe, Gas Lighter, Trolley etc. have been supplied to the petitioner and in discharge, two cheques were issued in favour of the complainant but the Cheque No. 691900 dated 30.5.2019 amounting to Rs.2,00,000/- got dishonoured for the reasons that payment was stopped by the drawer. Statutory notices were sent but the amount was not paid. The aforesaid allegation definitely makes out an offence. Whether the materials were supplied to the petitioner or not is a subject matter of trial. Without evidence it cannot be concluded on the facts as submitted by the petitioner. 
 Since an offence is made out against the petitioner underSection 138NI Act which apparent from the perusal of the complaint petition, I am not inclined to interfere with the impugned order dated 9.8.19 by which cognizance has been taken and summons have been issued . 
 Accordingly, this application stands dismissed.

 ------ 
 Heard the petitioner in person through video conferencing. He has no complain with respect to the audio and video clarity and quality. 
 The petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated 27th August, 2019 passed in Criminal Revision No. 225 of 2019 whereby revision application filed by this petitioner has been dismissed, affirming the order dated 20.12.2018 passed by JM,Ranchi in Complaint Case no. 2324 of 2018, by which after taking cognizance, though summon has been issued against other accused persons but opposite party no.5 herein was not summoned. 
 The petitioner is aggrieved by non summoning respondent no.5 Ram Narayan Singh. According to the petitioner the respondent no.5 who was the officer-in-charge at the relevant time of Mandor police station did not deliberately lodged the FIR on the information given by this petitioner. He submits that the said person in connivance with the other accused persons did not registered the FIR, which is a criminal offence. He submits that this act of the respondent no.5 was overlooked by the court while issuing summons and the court erroneously did not issue summons. He submits that against the said order the petitioner filed a revision application but the revision application was also dismissed after holding that the order is a well reasoned order which needs no interference. The gist of the petition is that the respondent no.5 should have been summoned by the court below and by not doing so, the court has committed illegality. 
 After hearing the parties, I find that court took cognizance of offence under Sections 167, 218, 466 read withSection 34IPC and thereafter summoned the accused person no. 1 to 4. Court also found prima facie case underSection 166IPC and summoned the accused no. 6. The court did not find any prima facie case to summon respondent no. 5.(It is needless to say that petitioner is aggrieved by this part). After hearing the parties, I find that since court at the stage of issuing summons did not find any material to issue summons to opposite party no.5, no fault can be found in the order. It is made clear that if at the later stage sufficient material comes up against the opposite party no.5, it will be open to the petitioner and the court to proceed accordingly. 
 With the aforesaid observation, this application stands disposed of.

 CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RONGON MUKHOPADHYAY 
 -------- 
 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel appearing for the State assisted by learned counsel for the O.P. No. 2. 
 Defects, as pointed out by the office, are ignored. The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Complaint Case No. 674 of 2019, registered for the offence punishable undersections 420,406,120B of the Indian Penal Code and u/s. 138 ofN.I. Act. 
 It has been alleged that the petitioner and Ram Balak Singh had obtained Rs. 3,00,000/- from the complainant for the sale of a trailor. The trailor was never handed over and a compromise was arrived at in which cheques were issued which got dishonoured. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the complaint petition would reveal that the amount, in question, was handed over to the accused Ram Balak Singh. It has further been stated that so far as the cheques purportedly issued by the petitioner is concerned, the same was obtained by force and coercion at the police station and with respect to the said act, the petitioner has already filed a complaint case against the O.P. No. 2, which is still pending. 
 Learned counsel for the O.P. No. 2 submits that on 03.10.2018 an agreement was entered into between the petitioner and the complainant in which the petitioner had agreed to return back the amount, but, since he had failed to do so cheques were issued by him which, however, got dishonoured subsequently due to stop payment. 
 Thus, it appears from the allegations that neither the trailor was handed over to the complainant nor the amount returned back and the subsequent complaint case filed by the petitioner may be by way of defence regarding the cheques which had been issued by the petitioners. 
 The submissions of both the learned counsels, therefore, indicate about the complicity of the petitioner as has been recorded in the complaint petition and in such circumstances, therefore, I am not inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. 
 This application, accordingly, stands rejected.

 Defects stand ignored for the present. 
 Heard the parties. 
 The petitioner, in this application, has challenged the FIR being Lalpur P.S. Case No. 222 of 2018 (G.R. No. 3566/2018), registered for the offence punishable underSection 420/409of the Indian Penal Code. 
 Counsel for the petitioner submits that no criminal offence is made out, which would be apparent from perusal of the FIR itself. He submits that there is dispute between the employee and the employer in relation to the statement of accounts, which cannot be a basis of the criminal offence. He submits that the petitioner was not being paid his salary and as he demanded his salary on 18.04.2018, so on 21.06.2018 the instant FIR was lodged against him. He further submits that from the FIR, it would be clear that the internal inquiry was continuing and without getting a report, the FIR has been lodged in haste. 
 Learned A.P.P. opposes the prayer. 
 I have gone through the FIR. The petitioner is an employee of Citizen Center Technologies Private Limited. There is allegation that this petitioner had defalcated money of the Company. Said allegation definitely makes out an offence for which investigation is necessary. The ground, which the petitioner has taken, cannot be looked into without leading evidence. When prima-facie a cognizable offence is made out a FIR cannot be quashed. On this principle of law, I find that in this case a cognizable offence is made out as there is allegation of defalcation of money of the Company, by the petitioner. Thus, I am not inclined to quash the FIR. Accordingly, this application stands dismissed.

 Heard Mr. Anoop Kumar Mehta, learned Counsel for the petitioner- Management and Mr. Niranjan Singh, Counsel appearing for the respondent. 
 It has been argued by Mr. Anoop Kumar Mehta that admittedly petitioner is entitled for gratuity, which is not in dispute as per Section 4(1) (c) & 4 (5) of thePayment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The workman has been paid the entire amount as per his entitlement. 
 Learned Counsel further argues that it is beyond the purview, scope and jurisdiction of the Appellate Authority to recalculate the amount which has already been determined under thePayment of Gratuity Actand to issue directions to the Management to make further payment. 
 On the other hand, Mr. Niranjan Singh, learned Counsel for the respondent opposing the contention of Mr. Mehta submits that as per clause (5) ofSection 4of the Payment of Gratuity Act, the workman is entitled for the enhanced amount. 
 To buttress his argument, Mr. Niranjan Singh places reliance on certain judgments and argues that in view of the ratio decided by the Hon'ble Apex Court the workman is entitled for the enhanced amount as determined by the Appellate Authority. 
 Since the workman has already received the amount, as determined, under thePayment of Gratuity Act, the only amount in dispute is Rs. 40,520/- 
 It has been further argued by Counsels for the parties that this issue requires hearing and as such the matter be admitted for hearing. 
 Admit. 
 Since the respondent has already appeared, no notice need be issued. 
 Parties may file additional documents by way of affidavit if they so wish.

 2. Heard Ms. Nehala Sharmin and Mr. Sanjay Kumar Shrivastava, the learned A.P.P.s appearing on behalf of the opposite party- State in Cr. Rev. No. 286 of 2014 and Cr. Rev. No. 1394 of 2016 respectively. 
 3. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the petitioner in Cr. Rev. No. 286 of 2014 namely Meena Devi was convicted by the learned trial court for offence underSection 411of Indian Penal Code and sentenced for a period of 1 year only, but while dismissing her appeal, the learned lower appellate court held that the sentence of the petitioner Meena Devi would be for two years. He submits that this happened because of the reason that the co-accused in the present case namely Raju Bansfore (petitioner in Cr. Rev. No.21394 of 2016) was convicted by the learned trial court for a period of three years with maximum sentence of three years and while partly allowing his appeal, he was ultimately convicted only underSection 411of Indian Penal Code and his sentence was reduced to two years. He submits that ultimately both the petitioners stood convicted for offence underSection 411of Indian Penal Code and punishment of the petitioner namely Raju Bansfore has been reduced from three years to two years and the punishment of Meena Devi has been enhanced from one year to two years without assigning any reason and without there being any petition for enhancement of sentence. He submits that the learned lower appellate court had no jurisdiction to enhance the punishment of the petitioner Meena Devi in an appeal filed by her that too without assigning any reason. 
 4. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that the petitioner in Cr. Rev. No. 1396 of 2016 has remained in custody for almost 9 months during the pendency of this revision petition and has also remained in custody for some time at the stage of trial. Accordingly, he prays that the sentence of Raju Bansfore (petitioner in Cr. Rev. No. 1394 of 2016) may be confined to the period already undergone. He also submits that if this Court finds proper, some fine amount may be imposed and the sentence of the petitioner Raju Bansfore be modified. 
 5. So far as the petitioner Meena Devi (petitioner in Cr. Rev. No. 286 of 2014) is concerned, he submits that she has also remained in custody at the stage of trial for some time and also at the stage of revision before this court. He further submits that considering the fact that Meena Devi is a female, some lenient view may be taken and the sentence be modified to the period already undergone by the petitioner Meena Devi and if found proper, some fine may be imposed. 
 6. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that from both the petitioners, one mobile each was recovered for which, they have been ultimately convicted underSection 411of Indian Penal Code only. 
 7. The learned counsels appearing on behalf of the opposite party- State have submitted that it is not in dispute that from both the petitioners, one mobile each was recovered. They further submit that it is also not in dispute that Meena Devi was convicted only for a period of one year by the learned trial court, but the learned lower appellate court held Meena Devi to undergo sentence for two years. The learned counsels submit that it appears that since the cases of both the petitioners were taken up together by the learned lower appellate court, such judgement has been passed. 
 8. Arguments are concluded. 
 9. Put up these cases tomorrow i.e. on 04.09.2020 under the heading ""For Final Disposal"".

 07/03.09.2020 Learned counsel for the petitioner Mr. Anupam Anand, at the outset, submits that he has received instructions from his client that the petitioner is still ready to keep the informant of the case who happens to be his wife. He submits that although a petition for divorce was filed by the present petitioner, but he did not pursue that case and ultimately, divorce has not been granted. 
 2. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that in view of these circumstances, the informant may be made opposite party no. 2 and notices be issued to her and the chances of compromise between the parties may be explored as the conviction in the present case is underSection 498Aof Indian Penal Code. 
 3. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party- State has no serious objection to the prayer made.

 02/03.09.2020 Heard Mr. Sabyasanchi, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Jitendra Pandey, learned A.P.P. for the State. 
 Defects as pointed out by the office are ignored. The petitioner has prayed for grant of anticipatory bail, as he is apprehending his arrest in connection with Sadar P.S. (Mahila) Case No. 03/2020. 
 The marriage of the informant was solemnized with the petitioner on 08.05.2019. It has been alleged that there was a demand of Rs. 1,50,000/-. It has further been alleged that on the first day itself the informant had come to know that the petitioner is already a married person. 
 Mr. Sabyasanchi, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that it is a false allegation regarding the petitioner having already married to another girl. It has further been submitted that from the First Information Report the allegation of demand of Rs. 1,50,000/- and the attempt at putting the informant on fire is against the other accused persons and not the petitioner. 
 Learned A.P.P. for the State has opposed the prayer for anticipatory bail made by the petitioner. 
 The First Information Report does not indicate specific allegation of assault or demand made by the petitioner. So far as the earlier marriage is concerned the petitioner has denied that he has ever married anyone prior to his marriage being solemnized with the informant. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petitioner accordingly is directed to surrender before the learned court below within a period of four weeks and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Hazaribagh in connection with Sadar P.S.

 -------- 
 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel appearing for the State. 
 Defects, as pointed out by the office, are ignored. The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with C.P. Case No. 1249 of 2018, registered for the offence punishable undersections 354(D),376,511,509,409,166(A)of the Indian Penal Code. 
 The informant is a widow and it is alleged that the petitioner used to regularly visit the house of the informant for collection work of Sahara India. It has further been alleged that the petitioner had attempted to commit rape upon her. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the informant is in the habit of instituting false cases and for that he has referred to Chas P.S. Case No. 113 of 2019, which was instituted against one Shantanu Kumar Sharma almost with the similar allegations. Learned counsel further submits that in the complaint case instituted against the petitioner the said Shantanu Kumar Sharma has been arrayed as a witness. Learned counsel submits that the prior to the institution of the complaint case an informatory petition was also filed by the petitioner apprehending that he will be implicated in a false case by the complainant. Learned counsel, therefore, on such parameters has prayed for grant of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. 
 Learned Spl.P.P. has opposed the prayer for anticipatory bail made by the petitioner. 
 It appears that the complaint case which is the subject matter of present anticipatory bail application was filed earlier to Chas P.S. Case No. 113 of 2019 and in such circumstance, therefore, the petitioner cannot get any advantage of Shantanu Kumar Sharma being a witness in the said complaint case. The allegations specifically reveal about the petitioner attempting to commit rape upon the complainant. The informatory petition said to have been filed by the petitioner is perhaps with an attempt to create a defence to stave off from the criminal prosecution which was likely to be instituted and which had subsequently been instituted by way of a complaint. 
 In view of the aforesaid facts, therefore, I am not inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. 
 This application, accordingly, stands rejected.

No. 435 of 2017) registered for the offence underSection 498A,323,377and511of the Indian Penal Code andSections 3/4of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, pending in the court of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Simdega. 
 5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that no offence is made out thus cognizance could not have been taken and initiation of the proceeding is also bad. He further submits that no date and time of torture was mentioned in the report, and there is also no allegation for demand of dowry ,thus the proceeding cannot be continued. He also submits that petition for restitution of conjugal right has been filed by the husband of the informant, in which, the informant has not appeared. 
 6. Learned A.P.P opposes the prayer of the petitioner. 
 7. After going through the record and the order impugned, I find that there is allegation against the petitioner that he tortured his wife and assaulted her. It also appears that primafacie cognizable offence is made out. When primafacie cognizable offence is made out, the FIR cannot be quashed. Not mentioning the date and time of torture is not fatal for the prosecution at this stage. Further, if there is no allegation for demand of dowry, the same cannot be a ground for quashing the FIR when there is specific allegations of torture upon the victim.

 It has been alleged that due to a land dispute, the petitioner no. 1 had assaulted the informant with a 'garasa'. The other accused persons were also variously armed and it is said that Sultan Ansari and Rajan Ansari were exhorting the others to kill the informant. 
 Petitioner No. 1 also appears to have filed a case against the informant and others being Dhruki P.S. Case No. 97 of 2019 with respect to the same incident. The informant is said to have suffered grievous injuries, which can be attributed to the assault committed upon him by the petitioner no. 1. 
 In view of nature of offence, I am not inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to petitioner no. 1 and the same is rejected. 
 However, so far as petitioner nos. 2 to 5 are concerned, the allegations being general and omnibus in nature and the same is on account of the free fight between both the sides, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to petitioner nos. 2 to 5. 
 Accordingly, the petitioner Nos. 2 to 5, named above, are directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, they will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- ( Ten thousand only) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st class, Garhwa in connection with Dhurki P.S.

 5. The main ground, which the petitioner has taken is that the cheque, which is the subject matter of the case, got lost for which, a Sanha was lodged. He further submits that the complaint was lodged only thereafter, which shows mala fide intention on the part of the complainant. He also submits that there was no agreement between the petitioner and the complainant and thus there is no question of giving any cheque to the complainant. He further submits that he is disputing the signature of the petitioner on the alleged agreement. He lastly submits that the petitioner was a student and was preparing for competitive examination. 
 6. A complaint was filed stating that the cheque bearing No. 071872, SBI, Begusarai (Bihar), was given by this petitioner and the same got dishonoured. Notices were sent to the petitioner in terms ofSection 138N.I. Act, but the amount was not paid. Thus, for dishonour of cheque, the present complaint was filed. Thereafter the court below took cognizance for the offence underSection 138N.I. Act. 
 7. The grounds, which have been taken by the petitioner, are the grounds of his defence which needs to be pr not for quashing the FIR. Whether the cheque got lost proved by leading evidence. Whether the agreement has been entered between the parties or not or whether the signature put on the said agreement is of the petitioner or not, cannot be looked into at this stage. The same can only be looked into during trial. 
 8. Since there is sufficient material to proceed against the petitioner, the court below has rightly taken the cognizance for the offence underSection 138N.I. Act, proceeded against the petitioner.

 Mr. Shekhar Sinha, the learned Public Prosecutor assisted by Mrs. Priya Shreshtha, the learned Spl. PP states that State has filed I.A. No. 3787 of 2020 brining on record the death certificate of the appellant, namely, Mubarak Mian @ Ansari.

 Order No. 02 Dated 03rd September, 2020 Heard the learned counsel for the respective sides. The defects, as pointed out by the office, are ignored. The petitioners apprehend their arrest in connection with Complaint Case No. 959 of 2017. 
 It has been alleged that the complainant had purchased a land in which he had constructed a house which was always objected to by the petitioners who happen to be the own brothers of the complainant. It has further been alleged that on 15.12.2017, the complainant and his wife were assaulted by the petitioners and Meena Devi had snatched the gold chain from the wife of the complainant and the petitioner No. 2 had caught the wife of the complainant from the back. On raising alarm, villages had assembled which led to the accused persons fleeing away from the place of occurrence. 
 It appears that after enquiry cognizance has been taken only u/s 323, 341 and 379of the Indian Penal Code. So far as theSection 379of the Indian Penal Code is concerned, from the complaint petition as well as the solemn affirmation of the complainant, the said allegation has been attributed to Meena Devi. 
 Regard being had to the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioners. The petitioners accordingly are directed to surrender before the learned court below within four weeks from today and on such surrender, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Bermo at Tenughat in connection with Complaint Case No. 959 of 2017, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

 08/ 20.08.2020 Heard learned counsel for the appellant No. 2 Jungi Yadav and learned counsel for the State, on the interlocutory application, filed on behalf of the appellant, for granting bail, during the pendency of this appeal.

 In the facts of this case, as also to the fact that the other co-accused persons have been granted bail by this Court and the appellant No. 2 was on bail during the pendency of the trial, we are inclined to release the appellant No. 2 Jungi Yadav, on bail. Accordingly, the appellant No. 2, named above, is directed to be released on bail, during the pendency of this appeal, on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (ten thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each, to the satisfaction of learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, Chatra, in connection with S.T.

 Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned counsel appearing for the State assisted by the learned counsel for the informant. 
 Defects, as pointed out by the office, are ignored. The petitioners apprehend their arrest in connection with Pakur(T) P.S. Case No. 193 of 2019, registered for the offence punishable undersections 341,323,504,379,34of the Indian Penal Code. 
 It has been alleged that the accused persons come to the house of the informant and started abusing him. The petitioner no. 1 had assaulted the informant on his head with an iron rod and the other accused persons had assaulted him with lathi. 
 It has been stated by the learned counsel for the informant that the case has been found to be true undersection 307of IPC. It has further been submitted that the petitioner no. 1 has three criminal antecedents. 
 It appears that the specific allegation of assault upon the informant with the iron rod has been attributed to the petitioner no. 1 who also has criminal antecedent. In such view of the matter, I am not inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner no.1, which is, accordingly rejected. 
 However, so far as the petitioner nos. 2 & 3 are concerned, the allegations are general and omnibus in nature. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner nos. 2 & 3. Accordingly, the petitioner nos. 2 & 3, above named, are directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, they will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand only) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned C.J.M., Pakur, in connection with Pakur(T) P.S.

 Heard the parties. 
 The petitioners, in this application, have challenged the order 27.08.2019, by which cognizance of the offence punishable underSection 384,387,323,406,504,506/34of the Indian Penal Code, has been taken and, thereafter, the petitioners were proceeded against. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the cognizance order is absolutely bad and is a non-speaking order and does not reflect as to what are the materials to issue summons against these petitioners. He submits that the requirement ofSection 204Cr.P.C. has not been dealt with in the impugned order. 
 After going through the record, I find that the order is absolutely cryptic and non-speaking and is not in conformity with the judgment passed by this Court in the case of ""Amresh Kumar Dhiraj & Ors.- versus- State of Jharkhand & Anr, reported in 2020 (1) JLJR 199"". What are the materials against the petitioners to proceed, has also not been mentioned. Thus, the impugned order dated 27.08.2019 is, hereby, set aside. The matter is remitted to the Court below to pass a fresh order in accordance with the provisions of law. 
 This criminal miscellaneous petition stands allowed.

 Order No. 02 Dated 3rd September, 2020 Heard the learned counsel for the respective sides. Defects, as pointed out by the office, are ignored. The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Littipara P.S. Case No.75 of 2019. 
 It has been alleged that the petitioner had physically exploited the informant on the pretext of marriage. Ultimately, the petitioner had to solemnize marriage. Although, the First Information Report was instituted underSection 376of the Indian Penal Code but cognizance has been taken underSection 498-Aof the IPC and Section-4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. The First Information Report appears to be replete with the allegations regarding the establishment of physical relationship with the informant on the pretext of marriage. However, the allegation regarding the marriage with the petitioner having not been solemnized with the informant has subsequently been nullified on account of the solemnization of the marriage and after investigation charge-sheet has been submitted underSection 498-Aof the IPC and Section-4 of Dowry Prohibition Act. 
 In view of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petitioner is directed to surrender before the learned court below within four weeks from today and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- (Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Pakur in connection with Littipara P.S.

 The marriage of the informant was solemnized with the petitioner No. 1 on 18.01.2017. It has been alleged that there was a demand of Rs. 5 Lakhs in cash and a four-wheeler and on non-fulfillment of which she was subjected to torture. 
 The petitioner No. 1 appears to be the husband of the informant while the petitioner No. 2 is her brother-in-law. 
 Mr. Jageshwar Mahto, learned counsel for the petitioners at the outset submits that the matter has been compromised between the parties and both the petitioner No. 1 as well as the opposite party No. 2 are residing together. 
 Mr. A.B. Mahto, learned counsel for the opposite party No. 2 has accepted such contentions advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioners. 
 In view of the compromise which has been arrived at, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioners. The petitioners accordingly are directed to surrender before the learned court below within four weeks from today and on such surrender, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Hazaribagh in connection with Giddi P.S.

 The petitioners, in this application, have challenged the order dated 04.09.2019, by which charge underSection 302,201/34of the Indian Penal Code, has been framed against them. 
 The petitioners did not file any discharge application. Counsel for the petitioners submits that due to the village politics the petitioners have been made accused in this case. Another ground, which has been submitted, is that only on suspicion the FIR has been lodged that too after six months. On the aforesaid grounds, they challenged the charge. 
 The grounds that have been urged are not at all tenable and cannot be a ground to set aside the charges which has been framed. All these grounds, which the petitioners have taken, need to be substantiated by evidence. 
 Since, there are materials to frame charge against the petitioners, the court proceeded and framed charge underSection 302,201/34IPC against them and the same has been explained, which is apparent from the form of the charge. Thus, I find no merit in this application. Accordingly, the same is hereby dismissed.

 Petitioner, in this application, has prayed to quash the FIR, registered for committing an offence punishable underSections 366Aof the Indian Penal Code. 
 Counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has got nothing to do in the entire occurrence. He submits that the victim is a major and is married with one Ambika Pandey. He submits that only on the basis of suspicion the father of the victim has lodged this FIR against this petitioner. He submits that since no offence is made out, the instant FIR is liable to be quashed. 
 I have heard counsel for the parties and have gone through the FIR. After going through the FIR, I find that the informant has alleged that his daughter was kidnapped and this petitioner has played an active role in the said occurrence. The averments, made in the FIR, definitely make out an offence. Further, I find that the FIR is of the year 2007, which is sought to be challenged in this application, filed in the year 2018. Further, learned APP has informed this Court that charge sheet in this case was filed way back in the year 2008 itself.

 Defects as pointed out by the office are ignored. The petitioner has prayed for grant of anticipatory bail, as he is apprehending his arrest in connection with Complaint Case No. 1680/2019. 
 The petitioner and the complainant were acquainted with each other for three years. It has been alleged that the petitioner had established physical relationship with the complainant on the pretext of marriage and subsequently resiled from his earlier commitment. 
 The informant is a major lady and was a consenting party to the sexual overtures made by the petitioner. 
 In such circumstances, therefore, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petitioner accordingly is directed to surrender before the learned court below within a period of four weeks and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Dhanbad in connection with Complaint Case No. 1680/2019, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

 The petitioner has challenged the order taking cognizance dated 17.3.2009 in the year 2019 by way of filing this petition, though he was all along aware of this case, which is apparent from the record as well as order impugned. 
 Counsel for the petitioner submits that other co-accused are not appearing in trial and thus the trial has not proceeded, so this application has been moved to quash the order taking cognizance. 
 Considering the fact that the petitioner has challenged the order dated 17.3.2019 after ten years, I am not inclined to interfere with the order taking cognizance dated 17.3.2009. However, the trial court is directed to split up the trial of this petitioner from the other accused persons, as they are not appearing in trial with a direction that the grounds taken by the petitioner in this petition, will be considered by the trial court concerned at appropriate stage.

 Defects, as pointed out by the office, are ignored. The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Complaint Case No. 2177 of 2019, registered for the offence punishable undersections 498A,406,34of the Indian Penal Code. 
 The marriage of the complainant was solemnized with the petitioner on 18.06.2017. It has been alleged that a demand was made for a bullet motor cycle and since the same was not fulfilled she was assaulted and ultimately ousted from her matrimonial house. Allegation has also been leveled about the petitioner solemnizing a second marriage. 
 It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that under the Santahl customs polygamy is permissible and, therefore, on such score, the petitioner cannot be proceeded against in the case u/s 498A I.P.C. 
 Learned counsel for the O.P. No. 2 has stated about the specific demand of bullet motorcycle made from the side of petitioner and the subsequent ouster of the complainant from her matrimonial house. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts it appears that the petitioner had solemnized a second marriage and there is also allegations regarding the demand and consequent torture upon the complainant on non- fulfillment of the said demand. 
 Regard being had to the aforesaid facts, I am not inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. 
 This application, accordingly, stands rejected.

 In this application, petitioners have prayed to quash the order date 31.7.2019. 
 Counsel for the petitioners submits that on the facts of this case no offence under Section 324 and 326 is made out. He submits that Hocky stick weapon was used, thus it cannot be said that the said weapon is a stiffer weapon by which murder can be committed. 
 Be that as it may, since cognizance has been taken and the reference of paragraph no.13 has been given in the impugned order from which court found that by Hocky stick and Rod, the injuries were inflicted, I am not inclined to entertain this application in which order taking cognizance has been challenged. 
 Accordingly, the instant application stands dismissed. 
 However at the time of framing of charge the court below should pass a reasoned order and will conclude as to whether there are ingredients to frame charge underSection 324and326IPC or not.

 2. The appellant is an accused in connection with SC/ST Case No.05 of 2019, arising out of Kisko Police Station Case No.24 of 2019, registered underSection 376of I.P.C and Section 3(2) (Va) of the Scheduled Caste &Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. 
 3. Having heard learned counsel for the appellant, learned A.P.P and on perusal of the status report, it appears that charge was framed on 19.11.2019 and till date no witnesses have been examined. As per the allegation in the F.I.R, the prosecutrix is aged 24 years and she has stated that for the past two-three years, on threats of killing her and her son, the appellant had established physical relationship with her. On 12.07.2019 he again established physical relationship and when she protested she was assaulted by the appellant. 
 Considering the delay in lodging of the F.I.R., I am inclined to enlarge the appellant on bail, on his furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Additional Sessions Judge - 1st, Lohardaga, in connection with Misc.

 Defects, as pointed out by the office, are ignored. The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Charhi P.S. Case No. 19 of 2020. 
 It has been alleged that the informant was threatened by the petitioner with respect to a land and when the informant was going to Hazaribagh, he was accosted by the petitioner and others and he was forced to sign on cheques.

 ""In the event of petitioner's arrest or his surrendering within a period of two months from the date of this order, he shall be released on bail on depositing a demand draft of Rs. 30,000/- as ad interim victim compensation in favour of opposite party no.2-Sima Kumari Yadav @ Sima Kumari Devi and on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned S.D.J.M., Jamtara, in connection with P.C.R. Case No.792 of 2017 with the condition that the petitioner will cooperate with the investigation of the case and appear before the Investigating Officer as and when noticed by him and will furnish his mobile number and a copy of his Aadhar Card in the court below with the undertaking that he will not change his mobile number during the pendency of the case. 
 In case, the petitioner deposits the ad interim victim compensation amount, the court below is directed to issue notice to the opposite party no.2-Sima Kumari Yadav @ Sima Kumari Devi and hand over the said demand draft to her, after proper identification. 
 In case, the said amount is received by the opposite party no.2, the same shall be adjusted with respect to the maintenance in any present or future proceeding between the parties or final settlement between the parties, if and when the same takes place.""

 It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the petitioners were directed to surrender before the court below within four weeks in terms of the order dated 07.02.2020, passed in A.B.A. No. 548 of 2020 but due to paucity of money and also because of the COVID -19 Pandemic, the petitioners could not surrender within the stipulated time.

 ------ 
 08/04.09.2020 The present criminal appeal is taken up today through Video conferencing. 
 I.A. No.3569 of 2020 The present interlocutory application has been filed on behalf of the appellant underSection 389(1)of the Cr.P.C. for suspension of sentence awarded to the appellant by the learned Trial Court during the pendency of the present appeal. 
 Learned counsel for the appellant submits that similar application of the petitioner was earlier rejected by this Court vide order dated 7th March, 2019 passed in I.A. No.1731 of 2019. The appellant has renewed his prayer for suspension of sentence awarded to him by the learned Trial Court, primarily on the ground that he has already served the half of the sentence of seven years. It is also submitted that learned Trial Court has erroneously convicted the appellant without considering the materials available on record in true perspective. It is a case in which the appellant had allegedly given a single blow with a wooden log on the head of the injured (Mangal Singh). 
 Mr. Ravi Prakash, learned Spl. P.P. though opposes the appellant's application filed underSection 389(1)of the Cr.P.C. on merit, yet he accepts the fact that the appellant has already undergone about three years and six months i.e., half of the sentence awarded to him by the learned Trial Court. 
 Having heard learned counsel for the parties, on perusal of the Lower Court Records and keeping in view that the appellant has already undergone half of the sentence awarded to him by the-2-learned Trial Court, I am inclined to suspend the sentence awarded to him by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-V, Jamshedpur in connection with S.T. No.352 of 2017. 
 Accordingly, the appellant above named, is directed to be released on bail, during the pendency of the present appeal, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.20,000/-(Rupees Twenty Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the court of learned Additional Sessions Judge-V, Jamshedpur in connection with S.T. No.352 of 2017. 
 The present interlocutory application stands disposed of.

 5. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the order impugned is cryptic and it does not suggest application of mind. He submit that what are the materials for taking cognizance, has not been reflected in the order impugned and the court below in most mechanical way without application of mind has passed the order impugned. 
 6. Learned A.P.P opposes the prayer of the petitioner but after going through the order impugned, he cannot justify the order impugned.

After going through the record and the order impugned, I find that the court below has taken cognizance for the offence under Section(s) 143, 341, 323, 448, 504of the Indian Penal Codeagainst the petitioners. What are the materials against the petitioner has not been mentioned in the order impugned. In most mechanical way, the order taking cognizance has been passed.

 The petitioner is an accused in a case registered for the offence punishable underSection 302/34of the Indian Penal Code. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner's prayer for bail was earlier rejected by this Court vide order dated 31st July, 2019 passed in B.A. No. 6485 of 2019. By way of present bail application, the petitioner has renewed his prayer for regular bail, primarily on the ground that co-accused Amar Singh against whom there is an allegation of stabbing the deceased (Vicky Nath), has already been granted regular bail by a co- ordinate Bench of this Court vide order dated 21st August, 2020 passed in B.A. No.5248 of 2020. It is further submitted that most of the prosecution witnesses who have been examined so far in the trial have not supported the case of the prosecution and the informant has been declared hostile by the prosecution. Considering the said fact, the petitioner who is in judicial custody since 18th April, 2019 may be given the privilege of regular bail. 
 The learned A.P.P. opposes the petitioner's prayer for bail. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and keeping in view that one of the main accused Amar Singh has already been granted bail in the present case, I am inclined to grant regular bail to the petitioner. Accordingly, the petitioner above named, is directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.20,000/-(Rupees Twenty Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the court of Additional Sessions Judge-III, Hazaribag in connection with S.T.

 CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RONGON MUKHOPADHYAY

 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel appearing for the State. 
 Defect no. 9(i), as pointed out by the office, is ignored. The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Bishnugarh P.S. Case No. 180 of 2016 (G.R. Case No. 3533 of 2016), registered for the offences punishable undersections 414&34of the Indian Penal Code. 
 It has been alleged that four motor cycles illegally loaded with coals were seized. The petitioner has been implicated as an accused on account of the fact that he is the registered owner of a seized motorcycle bearing registration JH09D5427. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the motorcycle, in question, had already been sold to one Phulendra Kumar on 14.08.2012 for which a sale letter has been referred. Learned counsel further submits that in a similar circumstance one of the co-accused namely Sharda Devi has been granted anticipatory bail by this Court in A.B.A. No. 8576 of 2019. It has also been submitted that the petitioner does not have any criminal antecedent. 
 Learned A.P.P. has opposed the prayer for anticipatory bail of the petitioner. 
 Prima facie, from the sale letter it appears that the petitioner has already sold the motorcycle to one Phulendra Kumar. However, nothing has been brought on record to indicate that the ownership has also been transferred in favour of Phulendra Kumar. If what has been stated by the learned counsel for the petitioner is true in such circumstances the investigating officer should also investigate the role of Phulendra Kumar if actually he appears to be the owner of the vehicle pursuant to the sale of the same in his favour by the petitioner. 
 Be that as it may, on consideration of the fact that the similarly situated co-accused has been granted anticipatory bail by this Court, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. Accordingly, the petitioner, above named, is directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, he will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Hazaribagh, in connection with Bishnugarh P.S. Case No. 180 of 2016 (G.R. Case No. 3533 of 2016), subject to the conditions as laid down undersection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

 ------------------ 
 Order No. 03/ Dated: 04th September, 2020 Mr. Swami Nath Prasad Rai, the learned counsel appears for the petitioner and states that charges were framed against the accused vide order dated 03.04.2018 however till now no witness has been examined by the prosecution. 
 This is second attempt by the petitioner in connection to Mirzachouki P.S. Case No.34 of 2016 corresponding to G.R. Case No. 321 of 2016. 
 Mrs. Ruby Pandey, the learned APP opposing the prayer for bail submits that sufficient evidence has been collected against the accused and now since charge has been framed against him, the presumption of innocence of accused has been substantially diluted. The learned APP further submits that period of custody normally is not a ground to enlarge an accused on bail particularly in serious offences likesection 366(A) of the Indian Penal Code. 
 The allegation against the petitioner is that he has taken the victim girl to Sonipat and sold her to another person who forced her to work as maid servant. The offence undersection 366(A) of the Indian Penal Code is punishable with imprisonment which may extend to ten years and with fine. The expression ""may extend to"" reflects the legislative intendment that maximum punishment shall2be awarded only in exceptional cases and not as a matter of routine. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the trial in Sessions Trial No.213 of 2017 has not progressed at all and till now no witness has been examined by the prosecution. It is really a very serious matter that in about 2½ years since charges were framed in the Sessions Trial vide order dated 03.04.2018, the prosecution has failed to examine a single witness. The petitioner is in custody since 07.03.2017 and the memo of evidence furnished to learned APP does not disclose any reason why in S.T Case No. 213 of 2017 any witness has not been examined by the prosecution. 
 Having regard to the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the petitioner above-named is directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupess Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned Additional Sessions Judge-1st, Sahibganj in connection to Mirzachouki P.S. Case No. 34 of 2016 (S.T Case No. 213 of 2017).

 Order No. 02 Dated 04th September, 2020 Heard the learned counsel for the respective sides. So far as the defects No. 5(e) and 9(iii) are concerned, if the same are existing, learned counsel for the petitioners is directed to remove the same once the situation normalizes. As regards the rest defects, as pointed out by the office, are concerned, the same are ignored. 
 The petitioners apprehend their arrest in connection with Sakchi P.S. Case No. 181 of 2019. 
 A development agreement was entered into between the petitioners and the informant. The petitioners were to handover two units in the second floor along with car parking apart from Rs. 16 Lakhs. It has further been alleged that the petitioners did not abide by the terms and conditions of the agreement. 
 Mr. Md. Zaid Ahmed, learned counsel for the opposite party No. 2 submits that the petitioners had not adhered to the conditions as instead of Rs. 16 Lakhs, Rs. 8 Lakhs had been paid to the informant. It has further been stated that so far as handing over of two units in the second floor is concerned, that was also not adhered to. 
 It appears that the agreement which was entered into between the petitioners and the opposite party No. 2 had an arbitration clause, which however was never invoked by the opposite party No. 2. It further appears that the case has been instituted after almost 9 years. The case of the petitioners as stated by Mr. D. K. Prasad, learned counsel for the petitioners is that further payment was stopped since on measurement, the area of land was found to be less than what had been recorded in the agreement. 
 The entire gamut of allegation therefore points to a civil dispute and in such circumstances, therefore, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioners. The petitioners accordingly are directed to surrender before the learned court below within four weeks from today and on such surrender, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate at Jamshedpur in connection with Sakchi P.S.

 The petitioners in this petition, have challenged the order dated 13.8.2018, by which, cognizance of the offence punishable under Section(s) 323, 341, 504, 506 and 34of the Indian Penal Code, has been taken by the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Palamau, in connection with Nawdiha Bazar P.S. Case No. 28/2018 (G.R. No. 1501 of 2018) and thereafter the petitioners have been summoned. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the order impugned is cryptic and is a non speaking order and does not reflect any subjective satisfaction as to what are the material to take cognizance against he petitioners. He submits that the requirement ofSection 204Cr.P.C has not been dealt with in the impugned order. 
 Learned A.P.P opposes the prayer of the petitioner but after going through the order impugned, he cannot justify the order impugned. 
 After going through the record and the order impugned, I find that the order is absolutely cryptic and non-speaking and is not in conformity with the judgment passed by this Court in the case of Amresh Kumar Dhiraj and Ors. Vs. State of Jharkhand and Another, reported in 2020 (1) JLJR 199 (Jhr.). What are the materials against the petitioners to proceed, has also not been mentioned. Thus, the impugned order dated 13.8.2018 is, hereby, set aside. The matter is remitted to he court below to pass a fresh order in accordance with law. 
 Accordingly, this petition stands allowed."

 ------- 
 02/04.09.2020 Heard Mr. S.S. Choudhary, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. V.K. Vasishtha, learned A.P.P. for the State assisted by Mr. Sanjay Kr. Pandey, No. 2, learned counsel appearing for the informant. 
 Defects as pointed out by the office are ignored. The petitioner has prayed for grant of anticipatory bail, as he is apprehending his arrest in connection with Ichak P.S. Case No. 203/2019. 
 It has been alleged that the informant and the petitioner had agreed to the sale and purchase of a land for which Rs. 3,92,500/- was paid by the informant. It has further been alleged that the petitioner did not get the land registered in the name of the informant nor the money which was taken returned back. 
 It appears that the petitioner has also filed a complaint case against the complainant for illegally procuring the agreement dated 11.12.2008 in order to grab the land of the petitioner. 
 It has been stated by Mr. S.S. Choudhary, learned counsel for the petitioner that the informant is an accused in a case of theft of government records in Ichak P.S. Case No. 212/2019. 
 Mr. Sanjay Kr. Pandey, No. 2, learned counsel for the informant has stated that neither the land was registered in favour of the informant nor the amount of Rs. 3,92,500/- returned back to the informant. He has further submitted-2-that a spate of cases have been filed by the petitioner against the informant. In such circumstances learned counsel submits that the present application is liable to be rejected. 
 The entire gamut of allegations as is revealed from above would indicate a civil dispute as it is with respect to the specific performance of a contract. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petitioner accordingly is directed to surrender before the learned court below within a period of four weeks and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned S.D.J.M. at Hazaribag in connection with Ichak P.S. Case No. 203/2019, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 This application stands allowed.

 Manish Kumar, learned counsel for the opposite party-husband are present through Video Conferencing. 
 Petitioner seeks transfer of Original Suit No. 13 of 2019 instituted before learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Daltonganj by the husband/opposite party herein for dissolution of marriage on grounds of cruelty and desertion under Section 13(1)(i-a)(i-b) ofHindu Marriage Act, 1955 to the Court of learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Dhanbad. Parties have solemnized marriage on 18th June 2011 as per Hindu Rites and Customs and they were blessed with a baby girl on 20 th August, 2012. Thereafter a case was instituted for restitution of conjugal rights which was decided ex parte. Petitioner has complained that because of approach of husband she has been residing at her parental house at Dhanbad with her minor daughter aged about 7 years. She is unable to attend and contest the divorce suit at Daltonganj with no sources of income. Daltonganj is separated by distance of more than 300 kilometres which is very onerous for her to cover alone with a minor child and stay overnight there before undertaking the return journey. Therefore, she has prayed for transfer of the case to Dhanbad. 
 Learned counsel for the opposite party has opposed the prayer. However, during course of arguments on the previous date i.e., 28th August, 2020, learned counsel for the opposite party proposed that the suit may be transferred to Bokaro instead of Dhanbad where both parties can appear in a tension free and independent environment. 
 Today, on instructions, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has no objection if the suit is transferred to the Family Court, Bokaro. 
 I have considered the submission of learned counsel for the parties, in the light of the facts and circumstances pleaded and the consensus between the parties on transfer of the Original Suit No. 13 of 2019. to the Family Court at Bokaro. It is true that petitioner may have had serious inconvenience in attending the suit at Daltonganj which is separated by a considerable distance and petitioner having no independent sources of income to maintain herself and her minor daughter. 
 In those circumstances and in view of consensus between the parties, it is deemed appropriate that the Original Suit No. 13 of 2019 be transferred from the Court of learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Daltonganj to the Court of learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Bokaro. 
 Let the records of Original Suit No. 13 of 2019 be transmitted to learned Family Court, Bokaro without any delay. 
 The instant petition stands disposed of. 
 Interim order dated 25.11.2019 stands vacated.

 06/04.09.2020 Heard Mr. Sahil, learned counsel for the petitioner and Ms. Mahua Palit, learned A.P.P. for the State as well as Ms. Amrita Sinha, learned counsel appearing for the opposite party no. 2. 
 The petitioner has prayed for grant of anticipatory bail, as he is apprehending his arrest in connection with Complaint Case No. 497/2019. 
 The marriage of the complainant was solemnized with the petitioner on 07.10.2017. It has been alleged that there was a demand of Rs. 1,00,000/- and a motorcycle and on non- fulfillment of which she was subjected to torture. On account of the torture meted out to the complainant she was taken away by her parents where she had given birth to a child. 
 It has been stated by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the complainant had preferred an application u/s 125Cr.P.C. in which pursuant to the order of the learned Family Court the petitioner is diligently paying an amount of Rs. 3,500/- per month to the complainant. It has further been stated that the main allegation appears to have been levelled against the mother-in-law of the complainant namely Mobina Khatoon. 
 Ms. Amrita Sinha, learned counsel appearing for the opposite party no. 2 submits that a mediation is going on and it is on the verge of being concluded. She has further stated that a positive outcome is expected in the mediation which is going on. 
 On a perusal of the complaint petition the allegation appears to be general and omnibus in nature so far as the-2-petitioner is concerned who happens to be the husband of the complainant. The primary allegations are centered around the mother-in-law Mobina Khatoon. The petitioner also appears to have shown his bonafide in regularly making payment of maintenance in terms of the direction of the learned Family Court to the complainant. Moreover, as stated by Ms. Amrita Sinha, learned counsel for the opposite party no. 2, there is a possibility of a positive outcome in the mediation which is going on. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, therefore, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petitioner accordingly is directed to surrender before the learned court below within a period of four weeks and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Koderma in connection with Complaint Case No. 497/2019, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 It is further made clear that the petitioner shall cooperate in the mediation process which as stated above is on the verge of being concluded. 
 Ms. Amrita Sinha, learned counsel who is appearing in the present case on behalf of the opposite party no. 2 through JHALSA has submitted the Vakalatnama through e-mail to this Court. 
 Let the same be kept on the record. 
 Ms. Sinha, is further directed that once she receives the original Vakalatnama she shall file the same in the drop box kept for such purpose.

 02/04.09.2020 The present bail application is taken up today through Video conferencing. 
 Petitioner is an accused for the offences punishable underSections 147/148/149/353/307/324/326/325/431/440/302/120-Bof the Indian Penal Code,Sections 3/4/5/ of theExplosive Substances Act, Sections 10/13 of the U.A.P. Act and Section 17(1)(2) of C.L.A. Act, in connection with S.T. No.09 of 2011 arising out of Nawadih P.S. Case no. 87 of 2006 corresponding to G.R. No. 874 of 2006, pending in the court of Additional Sessions Judge-I, Bermo at Tenughat. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that bail applications of the petitioner were earlier rejected by this Court five times. By way of present bail application, the petitioner has renewed his prayer for regular bail, primarily on the ground that he is in judicial custody for about six years and the trial has not yet been concluded. 
 Learned Special P.P. appearing on behalf of the State of Jharkhand submits that though the trial is not proceeding as per the required pace, yet it is a case in which 14 police personnel were killed in barbaric manner by MCC extremists. It is further submitted that eight charge- sheeted witnesses have been examined so far and several other material witnesses are yet to be examined. If the petitioner is granted bail, there is least possibility that he will co-operate in the trial. Hence, the petitioner may not be given the privilege of regular bail. 
 Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and keeping in view that the bail applications of the petitioner have earlier been rejected by this Court five times, I see no reason to reconsider the petitioner's prayer for bail. 
 Accordingly, the prayer for bail of the above named petitioner is rejected.

On conclusion of investigation, final form was submitted showing it to be a mistake of facts and on a protest petition having been filed by the complainant, cognizance was taken for the offence punishable u/s 304BI.P.C.

 Heard the learned counsel for the respective sides. The defects, as pointed out by the office, are ignored. The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Kadma P.S. Case No. 227 of 2019. 
 It has been alleged that the informant had given Rs. 10 Lakhs to the accused persons for completion of a movie. Agreements were also entered into to the effect that the complainant would be returned Rs. 10 Lakhs along with 15% interest. The amount however was never returned. 
 It has been stated by learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner along with another accused are the absolute owners of Bengali Talkies Pictures. He has submitted that the petitioner has directed several Bengali movies. He further submits that the petitioner is a member of Eastern India Motion Pictures Directors Association. Mr. Sah further submits that the finances for the film was arranged by Ashok Barua and in fact 90% of the shooting is almost complete. 
 Learned APP has opposed the prayer for anticipatory bail of the petitioner. The gamut of allegations levelled against the petitioner appears to be centered around the breach of the terms and conditions of the agreement which at best would invite civil consequences. 
 On such consideration, therefore, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petitioner accordingly is directed to surrender before the learned court below within four weeks from today and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Jamshedpur in connection with Kadma P.S.

 1. Office to delete the name of Mr. Suraj Mohan and mention the name of Mr. Sanat Kumar Jha, as the counsel for the State, in the daily cause list. 
 I.A. No.11415 of 2019 
 1. This interlocutory application has been filed underSection 389(1)of the Code of Criminal Procedure for suspension of the sentence and grant of ad-interim bail, to the petitioner, during the pendency of the appeal.

 Heard the learned counsel for the respective sides. The defects, as pointed out by the office, are ignored. The petitioners apprehend their arrest in connection with Chutia P.S. Case No. 162 of 2019. 
 It has alleged that the petitioners had taken a friendly loan of about 6.25 Lakhs, but refused to return the same to the informant. 
 It appears that the daughter of the informant was married to the son of the petitioner No. 1 on 11.05.2011 and due to illness she died on 17.07.2017. The son of the petitioner No. 1 had filed a case at Family Court, Ranchi for custody of his children and the present case seems to have been filed after the guardianship case filed by the son of the petitioner No. 1. The petitioner No. 1 appears to be the father-in-law of the deceased daughter of the informant, while the petitioners No. 2 and 3 are the brothers-in-law. Moreover, the amount in question appears to have been paid prior to the marriage. 
 In view of the bitter relationship existing between the parties, as indicated above, the false implication of the petitioners also cannot be ruled. 
 In the circumstances noted above, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioners. The petitioners accordingly are directed to surrender before the learned court below within four weeks from today and on such surrender, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Ranchi in connection with Chutia P.S. Case No. 162 of 2019, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

 02/04.09.2020 Heard Mr. Ashok Kr. Jha, learned counsel for the petitioners and Mr. S.K. Dubey, learned A.P.P. for the State. 
 Defects as pointed out by the office are ignored. The petitioners have prayed for grant of anticipatory bail, as they are apprehending their arrest in connection with Itki P.S. Case No. 68/2019. 
 It has been alleged that the elder brother of the informant had committed suicide. A suicide note was recovered which disclosed about the depression suffered by the deceased. 
 It appears that the petitioners are the in-laws of the deceased who have been alleged to have instigated him to commit suicide. In fact the wife of the deceased namely Manisha Tudu whose act of elopement after the solemnization of the marriage with the deceased purportedly leading the deceased to commit suicide has already been granted anticipatory bail by this Court in A.B.A. No. 2477 of 2020. 
 On consideration of the fact that the main accused Manisha Tudu has been granted anticipatory bail by this Court, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioners. The petitioners are accordingly directed to surrender before the learned court below within a period of four weeks and on such surrender, they shall be-2-released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate XIth at Ranchi in connection with Itki P.S.

 02/04.09.2020 Heard Mr. S.S. Choudhary, learned counsel for the petitioner and Ms. Anuradha Sahay, learned A.P.P. for the State. 
 Defects as pointed out by the office are ignored. The petitioner has prayed for grant of anticipatory bail, as he is apprehending his arrest in connection with Barhait Complaint Case No. 581/2018. 
 It has been alleged that the ancestral land in J.B. No. 35 of the complainant was fraudulently sold by the accused persons. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner has referred to a report of C.O., Sahibganj from which it appears that J.B. No. 361 which is also a bone of contention between the two parties stands recorded in the name of the grand father of the petitioner. Mr. Choudhary, has further submitted that with respect to the same issue two separate writ applications were filed before this Court. 
 In fact it appears that both the complainant as well as the petitioner claims the land in question to be there own. The dispute as it appears would invite civil consequences. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petitioner accordingly is directed to surrender before the learned court below within a period of four weeks and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with-2-two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned C.J.M., Sahibganj in connection with Barhait Complaint Case No. 581/2018, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

 05/04.09.2020 Heard learned counsel for the parties through video conferencing. They have no complain with respect to the audio and video clarity and quality. 
 Counsel for the petitioners submits that he has removed the defect(s) by filing supplementary affidavit. 
 In this application, petitioners have prayed to quash the composite order dated 8.01.2018 by which cognizance of the offence punishable underSection 498AIPC and Section ¾ ofDowry Prohibition Acthas been taken. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the cognizance order is absolutely bad and is a non-speaking order and it does not reflect any subjective satisfaction as to what are the materials to take cognizance against these petitioners. He submits that the requirements ofSections 190&204Cr.P.C has not been dealt with in the impugned order. 
 After going through the record, I find that the court below has merely filled up the blank in the order-sheet which suggests non-application of mind. I also find that the order is absolutely cryptic and non-speaking and is not in conformity with the judgment passed by this Court in the case of Amresh Kumar Dhiraj and Ors. Vs. State of Jharkhand &Anr., reported in 2020 (1) JLJR 199. What are the materials against the petitioners to proceed, has also not been mentioned. Thus, the impugned order dated 8.01.2018 passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Jamshedpur is, hereby, set aside. The matter is remitted to the court below to pass a fresh order in accordance with the provision of law. 
 This criminal miscellaneous petition stands allowed.

 Learned counsel for the State opposes the prayer for bail. The prayer for bail of the appellant no. 1 was earlier rejected in I.A. No. 8867 of 2019 on 07.01.2020. The appellant no. 1 appears to have completed for more than a year in custody and there is no chance of the appeal being heard in the near future.

So far as defect no. 9(ii), as pointed out by the office is ignored, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the said defect has been removed. Office to check and verify and if the same has not been removed learned counsel shall remove the same once the situation normalizes. So far as the rest defects, if any, are concerned, the same are ignored. 
 The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Bano P.S. Case No. 20 of 2019 (G.R. Case No. 167 of 2019), registered for the offence punishable undersections 379,414,279/34of the Indian Penal Code. 
 One 407 vehicle loaded with woods met with an accident. The driver had disclosed about the persons involved in illegal transportation of woods. Suspicion has been cast upon the petitioner on account of the fact that the petitioner was in regular contact with the other accused persons. It appears that some of the co-accused persons have been granted anticipatory bail by this Court in A.B.A. No. 7325 of 2019. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. Accordingly, the petitioner, above named, is directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, he will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Simdega, in connection with Bano P.S.

 The petitioners, in this application, have challenged the order 13.05.2019, by which cognizance of the offence punishable underSection 420/34of the Indian Penal Code, has been taken and, thereafter, the petitioners have been summoned. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the cognizance order is absolutely bad and is a non-speaking order and does not reflect any subjective satisfaction as to what are the materials to take cognizance against these petitioners. He submits that the requirement ofSection 204Cr.P.C. has not been dealt with in the impugned order. 
 After going through the record, I find that the order is absolutely cryptic and non-speaking and is not in conformity with the judgment passed by this Court in the case of ""Amresh Kumar Dhiraj & Ors.- versus- State of Jharkhand & Anr, reported in 2020 (1) JLJR 199"". What are the materials against the petitioners to proceed, has also not been mentioned. Thus, the impugned order dated 13.05.2019, passed by the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Ranchi is, hereby, set aside. The matter is remitted to the Court below to pass a fresh order in accordance with the provisions of law. 
 This criminal miscellaneous petition stands allowed.

 Order No.02 Dated 4th September, 2020 Heard the learned counsel for the respective sides. Defects, as pointed out by the office, are ignored. The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Lower Bazar P.S. Case No.128 of 2019. 
 It has been alleged that the informant had purchased the land on the assurance and inducement of the accused persons. An agreement was entered into and the informant had also paid a huge amount. However, the sale deed was not executed nor the amount of Rs.14,00,000/- was returned. It appears that the First Information Report has been instituted after 5 years. It further appears from the allegations that the same basically reveals breach of the terms and conditions of the agreement which could at best invite civil consequences. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petitioner is directed to surrender before the learned court below within four weeks from today and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- (Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, at Ranchi in connection with Lower Bazar P.S.

 The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Koderma (Mahila) P.S. Case No. 08 of 2019, registered for the offences punishable under sections 494, 498 A, 34of the Indian Penal Code. 
 The marriage of the informant was solemnized with the petitioner ten years back. It has been alleged that when her health deteriorated she has ousted from her matrimonial house and on 18.06.2019, the petitioner had solemnized marriage with another girl. 
 It appears that there is no denial with respect to the solemnization of the second marriage by the petitioner. It further appears from the impugned order that the witnesses have supported the allegations including that of the petitioner solemnizing the second marriage. 
 In view of the aforesaid facts, I am not inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. 
 This application, accordingly, stands rejected. However, if the petitioner surrenders before the learned court below within a period of three weeks and prays for bail, the learned court below shall endeavor to dispose of the bail application expeditiously without being prejudiced by this order.

In his cross-examination, the P.W.8 has stated that after the signature of the A.L.C., the file was to be dispatched to section and from there, letter was to be dispatched to the concerned person.

He identified the F.I.R. A trap team was constituted of which P.W.9 was also a member. On 15.07.1998 the members of the trap team assembled in the C.B.I. office for carrying out the pre-trap formalities. P.W.1 was also present. P.W.9 has described about the pre-trap formalities in detail. P.W.1 produced Rs.200/- in front of everybody. Phenolphthalein powder was smeared on the notes and the numbers of the notes were noted down. A preliminary memorandum was prepared mentioning all the proceedings. The denominations of the general currency notes were also mentioned in the said preliminary memorandum. They reached 12 Cr. Appeal (SJ) No.1167 of 2008 the office of the Regional Labour Commissioner. P.W.1 and P.W.2 went to the office table of the appellant-accused where the appellant-accused was sitting. The pre-fixed signal was received from the P.W.2 after sometime and the P.W.9 entered inside the hall. The appellant-accused was challenged for having received bribe amount of Rs.200/- from the P.W.1 and he was arrested there. P.W.2 disclosed that the appellant accused has put the money in the right side pocket of his pant. On being told by the P.W.9, the P.W.4 recovered Rs.200/- from the right pocket of the appellant-accused. The denominations and number of each note tallied with the denominations and numbers mentioned in the preliminary memorandum. The said seized money was sealed in an envelope. He identified the currency notes. Both the hands of the appellant-accused was washed one by one with sodium carbonate solution. The colour of both the solutions turned pink. The solutions were kept in two separate bottles and sealed. The inner lining of the right pant pocket of the appellant-accused was also washed with sodium carbonate solution and the colour of the same also turned pink. The pant of the appellant-accused was also seized. After arresting the accused, arrest memo was prepared. On being proved by him, the memo of recovery has been marked Exhibit -15. A copy of the memo of recovery was also given to the appellant-accused and the appellant- accused put his signature acknowledging receipt of the said memo of recovery which on being proved by the P.W.9 has been marked as Exhibit -16. P.W.9 during the course of investigation seized the documents including the concerned file. During the course of investigation, the P.W.9 who is also the I.O. of the case recorded the 13 Cr. Appeal (SJ) No.1167 of 2008 statement of the witnesses, sent the bottles containing the sodium carbonate solution for chemical examination to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Calcutta. He obtained the report of the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Calcutta and also obtained the sanction for prosecution of the appellant-accused and thereafter submitted charge sheet. In his cross-examination, the P.W.9 stated that he has mentioned about the pre-trap formalities in detail in the pre-trap memorandum. He took the format of the personal search memo and arrest memo from the C.B.I. office as a routine procedure. 
 14. After closure of the evidence of the prosecution, the statement underSection 313Cr.P.C. of the appellant-accused was recorded regarding the circumstances appearing in evidence against him in which he denied the allegations made against him and also stated that he has no knowledge about such allegations but he admitted his signature on Exhibit -15 and stated that the said Exhibit - 15 was prepared by the C.B.I. Officers in the C.B.I. office and the appellant-accused does not know what was written in Exhibit -15 but C.B.I. people obtained his signature there. In his defence he has stated that there was lot of commotion and arguments regarding handing over of the gratuity order by hand delivery to the P.W.1 as there is no such provision of hand delivery of the order and at this, the P.W.1 went away threatening the appellant-accused and the appellant- accused did not handover the copy of the order to the P.W.1, hence the P.W.1 has falsely implicated the appellant-accused in this case. 
 15. In his defence, the appellant-accused examined two witnesses. 
 14 Cr. Appeal (SJ) No.1167 of 2008 
 16. D.W.1 - Aalok Das is an Upper Division Clerk (U.D.C.) of office of the Deputy Labour Commissioner. He produced the photocopy of the letter dated 16th July, 1998 written by the P.W.7 which was marked -Q/1 for identification. He also produced and proved the FOC file which was marked Exhibit -B. Another payment of gratuity file was marked Exhibit -C and the annual confidential report of the appellant-accused from 1992-1998 and 2002 -2003 was marked -Q/2. In his cross-examination the D.W.1 has stated that he has no knowledge about the documents produced by him. 
 17. D.W.2 -Sisir Kumar Pal has stated that in the year 1997-98, the P.W.7 was working as Assistant Labour Commissioner (Central) in the office of Deputy Chief Labour Commissioner. He proved the daily diary which was marked Exhibit -D. In his cross-examination, he has stated that he has no personal knowledge about what has been written in that daily diary. 
 18. The learned court below, after taking into consideration the evidence in the record came to a conclusion that the prosecution has fully proved and established the charges levelled against the appellant- accused person and convicted and sentenced him as already indicated above. 
 19. It is submitted by Mr. B.M. Tripathi, leaned Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant-accused that the impugned order and sentenced passed by the learned trial court is bad in law and is not sustainable. It is next submitted by the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant-accused that the trial court has not properly securitized the statement of witnesses and has given finding 15 Cr. Appeal (SJ) No.1167 of 2008 contrary to the material in record by ignoring the material contradictions in the testimonies of witnesses. It is next submitted by learned Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant-accused that the prosecution has failed to prove the chemical examination report and the testimony of P.W.2 creates doubt as he has all along in his testimony stated that one Ashraf Ali has paid the bribe to the appellant-accused and in his testimony though before concluding his examination-in-chief, he has also stated that Ashraf Ali is also known as Sohrab Ali who is the complainant of the case but he could not stand scrutiny of the cross-examination and from which it is apparent that the appellant-accused has not deposed in connection with this case but he has deposed in connection with some other cases relating to Ashraf Ali. Hence, it is submitted that as the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, the appellant-accused be acquitted at least by giving him the benefit of doubt. 
 20. Mr. Rohit Sinha, learned counsel for the C.B.I. on the other hand defended the impugned judgment and submitted that all prosecution witnesses have stated different parts of the prosecution case in their testimonies and nothing has been elicited in the cross- examination of P.Ws.1, 5 and 9 and the testimonies of P.Ws.1 and 9 has been corroborated by the independent witnesses being the shadow witness P.W.2 and the trap witness being P.W.4. Hence, it is submitted that there is ample evidence in the record to establish both the charges of which the appellant-accused has been held guilty, convicted and the sentence is also appropriate. Hence, it is submitted that the conviction 16 Cr. Appeal (SJ) No.1167 of 2008 of the appellant-accused be confirmed and this appeal being without any merit be dismissed. 
 21. Having heard the submissions made at the Bar and after carefully going through the record, it is crystal clear that it is a settled principle of law as has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case ofState of U.P. vs. Zakaullahreported in (1998) 1 SCC 557 wherein in the facts of that case where the complainant's evidence was jettisoned on the mere ground that since he had a grouse against the delinquent public servant he might falsely have implicated the public servant, that such a premise is fraught with the consequence that no bribe giver can get away from such stigma in any graft case. The very fact that the complainant lodged a complaint with the Anti- Corruption Bureau is reflective of his grievance. Such a handicap in his evidence may require the court to scrutinize it with greater care, but it does not call for outright rejection of his evidence at the threshold. In the case ofHazari Lal vs. State (Delhi Administration) reported in (1980) 2 SCC 390 which was reiterated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in paragraph no.10 ofState of U.P. vs. Zakaullah(supra) it was observed that every citizen of India must be presumed to be an independent person until it is proved that he was a dependent on police or other officials for any purpose whatsoever. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in paragraph no.11 and 12 ofState of U.P. vs. Zakaullah(supra) relying upon the judgment in the case ofPrakash Chand vs. State (Delhi Administration) reported in (1979) 3 SCC 90 andHazari Lal vs. State (Delhi Administration) (supra) has held that officer who arranges the trap makes arrangement to smear 17 Cr. Appeal (SJ) No.1167 of 2008 phenolphthalein power in currency notes in order to satisfy himself that the public servant had in fact received the bribe and not that the currency notes were just thrust into the pocket of any unwilling officer. Such a test is conducted for his conscientious satisfaction that he was proceeding against a real bribe taker and that an officer with integrity is not harassed unnecessarily. Regarding not sending the solution collected in a phial during the trap for chemical examination, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in paragraph no.13 ofState of U.P. vs. Zakaullah(supra) has observed that the solution in a trap case is also viewed not because there is any such direction by the statuary provision but for the satisfaction of the officer that the suspected public servant would have clearly handled the bribe money if there is no material discrepancy in the evidence regarding preparation of recovery-memo, the reliability of the trap cannot be stated to be impaired for not sending the solution collected in a phial during the trap for chemical examination. 
 It is pertinent to mention here that this is not a case where the sodium carbonate solution was not given for chemical examination rather in this case the sodium carbonate solution having trace of phenolphthalein was sent for chemical examination and the chemical examination report was on the record but it has not been marked Exhibit. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case ofBhupinder Singh vs. State of Punjabreported in AIR 1988 SC 1011 has held in paragraph no.13 that no hard and fast rule can be laid down as regards the value to be attached to the report of the chemical examiner.Section 293of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the report of 18 Cr. Appeal (SJ) No.1167 of 2008 scientific experts may be used as evidence in any inquiry, trial or other proceedings of the court. The chemical examiner does not as a rule give an opinion as to the cause of death but merely gives report of the chemical examination of the substance sent to him. The report by itself is not crucial. It is a piece of evidence. The only protection to it is that it does not require any formal proof. 
 So in this case at best it was an oversight on the part of the trial court for marking of the chemical examination report as an Exhibit. Under such circumstances, this Court is of the considered view that the contention of the appellant-accused that the chemical examination report has not been proved in this case is a quail statement for setting aside the conviction of the appellant-accused as made by the trial court. 
 22. So far as the discrepancy of the evidence is concerned, it is pertinent to mention here that it is a settled principle of law as has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case ofState of U.P. vs. Dr. O.K. Ghoshreported in AIR 1984 SC 1453 that the police officer dealing with the trap team is interested in success of the trap to ensure that citizen who complains of harassment by the Government Officer making a demand of illegal gratification is protected and the role of his department in the protection of such citizen is vindicated. It may be contended that such police officer is interested in the success of the trap so that his ego is satisfied or that he earns a feather in his cap but it must be realized that is it not frequently that a police officer himself being a Government Servant would resort to perjury and concoct evidence in order to rope in an innocent Government Servant 19 Cr. Appeal (SJ) No.1167 of 2008 and in the event of Government Servant concerned refusing to accept the currency notes offered by the complainant, it would not be reasonable to expect the police officer to go to the extent of concocting a false seizure memo for prosecuting and humiliating him merely in order to save the face of the complaint thereby compromising his own conscience. The court may therefore depending on the circumstances of a case feels safe in accepting the prosecution version on the basis of the oral evidence of the complaint and the police officers even if the trap witnesses turn hostile or are found not to be independent. When therefore besides such evidence there is circumstantial evidence which is consistent with the guilt of the accused and not inconsistent with his innocence, there should be no difficulty in upholding the prosecution case. It is also a settled principle of law that if the witness are examined after so long time after the occurrence, such witnesses are not expected to recollect and narrate the entire version with photographic memory notwithstanding the hiatus and passage of time as has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case ofVinod Kumar Garg vs. State (Govt. of National Capital Territory of Delhi) reported in (2020) 2 SCC 88 paragraph no.14 of which reads as under :- 
 ""14. The contradiction that have crept in the testimonies of Nand Lal (PW2) and Hemant Kumar (PW3) noticed above and on the question of the total amount demanded or whether Nand Lal (PW2) had earlier paid Rs.500 are immaterial and inconsequential as it is indisputable that the bribe was demanded and taken by the appellant on 3-8-1994 at about 10:30 a.m. The variations as highlighted lose significance in view of the proven facts on the recovery of bribe money from the pant pocket of the appellant, on which depositions of Nand Lal (PW2), Hemant Kumar (PW3) and Rohtash Singh (PW5) are identical and not at variance. The money recovered was the currency notes that were treated and noted in the pre-raid proceedings vide Ext.PW2/G. The 20 Cr. Appeal (SJ) No.1167 of 2008 aspect of demand and payment of the bribe has been examined and dealt with above. The contradictions as pointed out to us and noted are insignificant when juxtaposed with the vivid and eloquent narration of incriminating facts proved and established beyond doubt and debate. It would be sound to be cognitive of the time gap between the date of occurrence, 3-8-1994, and the dates when the testimony of Nand Lal (PW2) was recorded, 9-7-1999 and 14-9-1999, and that Hemant Kumar's (PW3) testimony was recorded on 18-12-2000 and 30-01-2001. Given the time gap of five to six years, minor contradictions on some details are bound to occur and are natural. The witnesses are not required to recollect and narrate the entire version with photographic memory notwithstanding the hiatus and passage of time. Picayune variations do not in any way negate and contradict the main and core incriminatory evidence of the demand of bribe, reason why the bribe was demanded and the actual taking of the bribe that was paid, which are the ingredients of the offence underSections 7and13of the Act, that as noticed above and hereinafter, have been proved and established beyond reasonable doubt. Documents prepared contemporaneously noticed above affirm the primary and ocular evidence. We, therefore, find no good ground and reason to upset and set aside the findings recorded by the trial court that have been upheld by the High Court. Relevant in this context would be to refer to the judgment of this Court inState of U.P. v. G.K. Ghoshwherein it was held that in a case involving an offence of demanding and accepting illegal gratification, depending on the circumstances of the case, it may be safe to accept the prosecution version on the basis of the oral evidence of the complaint and the official witnesses even if the trap witnesses turn hostile or are found not to be independent. When besides such evidence, there is circumstantial evidence which is consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with his innocence, there should be no difficulty in upholding the conviction."" 
 23. After going through the evidence in record, this Court is of the considered view that in the absence of any cross-examination regarding the material parts of the testimonies of P.Ws. 1 and 9 regarding the ingredients of the offence punishable underSection 7andSection 13(2) read with 13 (1) (d) ofPrevention of Corruption Act.1988 that is demand of bribe, acceptance of bribe by the appellant- accused and recovery of bribe money from him, the same remains 21 Cr. Appeal (SJ) No.1167 of 2008 unchallenged and is to be treated as true. The testimonies of prosecution witnesses are corroborated by the evidence of independent witnesses being P.Ws.4, 2 and 5. Though P.W.7 was declared hostile on the point of recovery but after being put leading questions, he also admitted that he stated before C.B.I. about the recovery of the bribe money from the appellant-accused. So the testimony of P.W.7 in support of the portion of the case of the prosecution also cannot be discarded. The oral testimonies of the prosecution witnesses is supported by the documentary evidence being the pre trap memorandum, recovery memorandum and also the material exhibits being the currency notes, the pant of the appellant-accused. There are evidence to establish that the appellant-accused was the steno on the date of occurrence and he prepared the order on the same day obviously upon the complainant approaching with a bribe amount of Rs.200/- to be paid to him a day before as per the verification process of the complaint which is also corroborated by the oral testimonies of P.W.1 and P.W. 5. The testimonies of the defence witnesses have no way established any fact to discredit the evidence put forth by the prosecution, as mentioned above to cast any doubt upon the charges, which have been proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. Under such circumstances, this Court is of the considered view that the evidence in record is sufficient to establish the charges of the offence punishable underSection 7andSection 13(2) read with 13 (1) (d) ofPrevention of Corruption Act, 1988 against the appellant-accused beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, the conviction of the appellant- accused is confirmed. 
 22 Cr. Appeal (SJ) No.1167 of 2008 
 24. So far as the sentence of the appellant-accused is concerned, it is a settled principle of law that undue sympathy to imposed inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system by undermining the public confidence in the efficacy of law. To award the lesser punishment for the convict would be to render the judicial system of the country suspect. Sentence imposed by the court should be commensurate with seriousness of the offence and should have a deterring effect on the wrong doers. Corruption by public servant has become gigantic problem and for that reason in the year 2014 the minimum sentence for the offence punishable underSection 7has by amendment been enhanced to be not less than three years and for the offence punishable underSection 13(2) is not less than four years.The Prevention of Corruption Actintends to make effective provision for prevention of bribe and corruption rampant among the public servants. The efficacy in public servants would improve and purpose of enactment of thePrevention of Corruption Actcan only be achieved when the public servant does his duty truthfully and honestly and for that a deterrent punishment is required. Under such circumstances, the sentence of three years each with fine, with default clause as imposed by the learned trial court is proper and also does not warrant any interference. Accordingly, this appeal being without any merit is dismissed. 
 
 25. Perusal of record reveals that the appellant-accused- Sujeet Kumar Mukharjee is on bail. In view of the dismissal of the appeal, bail granted to the appellant-accused- Sujeet Kumar Mukharjee is cancelled. The appellant-accused- Sujeet Kumar Mukharjee is directed 23 Cr. Appeal (SJ) No.1167 of 2008 to surrender before the learned court below within six weeks from the date of this judgment failing which, the learned trial court will take coercive steps for apprehension of the appellant-accused for undergoing the sentence. 
 
 26. Let the Lower Court Records along with a copy of this Judgment be sent to the court below forthwith.

 4. It is the case of the petitioners that Madrasa Darul Hades, Harinkol, PO Mandro, PS Mirzachowki, District-Godda has published one advertisement in daily news paper on 01.06.2017. The said advertisement was on the basis of the orders of the respondent no.5 vide letter dated 18.05.2017 and accordingly post of Alim was advertised. The petitioners applied for the selection process in terms of the advertisement. The last date for submission of the application form was prescribed as 22.06.2017 and by that time, all the petitioners had submitted their application forms. The selection was required to be made on the basis of the written as well as oral test and interview. The marks obtained by the petitioners have been disclosed in paragraph no.13 of the writ petition. The merit list was published which is contained in Annexure-3. The appointment letters were issued in favour3of the petitioners on 22.07.2017 by Madrasa Darul Hades, Harinkol, District-Godda and therefore the petitioners tried to join, but posting was not disclosed to the petitioners. The petitioners have filed the representation by way of Annexure-5 series. The State Government has also given the sanction by way of letter dated 09.10.2017 as contained in Annexure-H to the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent nos.6 and 7. 
 5. Mr. Saurabh Shekhar, the learned counsel for the petitioners submits that although there is a rider whereby the advertisement was allowed to be published by the respondent-JAC that the entire exercise needs to be completed within 45 days. He has submitted that the entire exercise has been completed in 49 days and not within 45 days as suggested by the respondent-JAC. He submits that so far as the 45 days' criteria is concerned, that is not statutory. He further submitted that due to certain unavoidable circumstances as Government employee who were brought to the committee were not available and that is why that delay has been taken place. The delay is not due to any fault on behalf of the petitioners or respondent nos.6 and 7. He further submits that the appointment letters were already in the hands of the petitioners and that is why the petitioners have preferred this writ petition in the nature of mandamus. 
 6. Mr. Anil Kumar, the learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent-JAC, at the outset, draws the attention of the Court to page-20 of the counter affidavit which is a letter dated 12.12.2017 whereby the approval of the appointment of the petitioners were negated relying on clause-III of the letter by which the process of appointment was initiated which speaks of completion of the process4within 45 days. He submits that this order has not been challenged and in that view of the matter, no relief can be extended to the petitioners. The learned Senior counsel further argues that the letter dated 18.05.2017 is administrative letter whereby appointment process has been directed to be initiated cannot be overlooked on the ground that it is mandatory or not. He submits that in view of this letter, the entire exercise was need to be completed in terms and conditions stipulated in the said letter. 
 7. Mr. Prem Pujari Roy, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent nos.6 and 7 submits that the respondent nos.6 and 7 made all efforts to make the selection process within the stipulated time and all the guidelines have been followed in terms of the letter dated 18.05.2017. The advertisement was published on 01.06.2017 and thereafter a gap of 21 days was maintained for the candidates to apply as per clause no.2 of the permission letter issued by the respondent no.5. Thereafter, the names of the candidates selected on merit by the Interview committee was to be proposed and kept before the Appointing/Managing committee, notified to be held on 14.07.2017 but due to unavailability of Government officials of the managing committee the meeting could not take place on the said date. The notice of meeting was made available to the members on 07.07.2017. Since the meeting could not take place on 14.07.2017, the next date of meeting was decided to be held on 21.07.2017 which duly happened and unanimous decision was taken to make appointment. This was sent before the District Education Officer, Godda on 24.07.2017 and by this fact the respondent nos.6 and 7 have completed the process within 49 days. The learned counsel for the respondent State accepted that the State has5already given the approval. Replying to the submissions of learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent-JAC, Mr. Saurabh Shekhar, the learned counsel for the petitioners submits that this Court has ample powers underArticle 226of the Constitution of India to grant relief if the same is not disputed. 
 8. He referred to the judgment rendered in the case of ""ESI Corpn. v. Jardine Henderson Staff Assn."" reported in (2006) 6 SCC 581. Paragraph no.63 of the said judgment is quoted hereinbelow : 
 ""63. The High Court underArticle 226and this Court underArticle 136read withArticle 142of the Constitution of India have the power to mould the relief in the facts of the case."" 
 9. He further draws the attention of the Court to the judgment of the Hon'ble Patna High Court in the case of ""Brij Bhukan Kalwar and Ors. v. S.D.O. Siwan and Ors."" reported in AIR 1955 Patna 1 (Special Bench). Paragraph no.5 of the said judgment is quoted hereinbelow : 
 5. But, before I proceed to determine what orders should be passed in each of these cases, I have to pronounce upon the validity or otherwise of the Act or that part of the Act which is impugned. 
 ""An unconstitutional Act is not law, it confers no rights, it imposes no duties, it affords no protection, it creates no office; it is, in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed.""- Field J. in - 'Norton v. Shelby County', (1885) 118 US 425 (A). 
 Willoughby has quoted the following passage from the judgment of the Court of West Virginia in - 'Shepherd v. Wheeling', 30 W Va 479 (B) and has observed that the doctrine that the judicial declaration of the unconstitutionality of a statute has not the effect of a veto or nullification or abrogation of the statute so as, in effect, to strike it from the statute books, is excellently stated in this judgment: 
 ""(The Court) does not annul or repeal the statute6if it finds it in conflict with the Constitution. It simply refuses to recognize it, and determines the rights of the parties just as if such statute had no application. The Court may give its reasons for ignoring or disregarding the statute, but the decision affects the parties only, and there is no judgment against the statute. The opinion or reasons of the Court may operate as a precedent for the determination of other similar cases, but it does not strike the statute from the statute book; it does not repeal......the statute. The parties to that suit are concluded by the judgment, but no one else is bound. A new litigant may bring a new suit, based on the very same statute, and the former decision cannot be pleaded as an estoppel, but can be relied on only as a precedent. 
 This constitutes the reason and basis of the fundamental rule that a Court will never pass upon the constitutionality of a statute unless it is absolutely necessary to do so in order to decide the case before it."" 
 No particular points have been formulated for determination by this Special Bench, and what we have to determine is whether any of these applications is fit to succeed, and, certainly, if the applications are to succeed, at least certain portions of the statute will have to be declared unconstitutional and void. Some of these applications have been contested not only on behalf of the State but also on behalf of certain private parties, and, in fact, Mr. Amin Ahmad who has appeared for the opposite party in Miscellaneous Judicial Case No.173 of 1953 has defended this Act much more strongly than the learned Government Advocate. 
 He was supported to some extent by the learned Advocate-General who gave the final reply on behalf of the State. We shall, therefore, have to give our judicial pronouncement against the statute only in so far as it is necessary for the determination of the rights claimed by the petitioners, and in cases in which there is contest on behalf of private parties, we will have to give the same amount of consideration and weight to the submissions made on their behalf which we are bound to give to the submissions made on behalf of the State. 
 
 10. He further submits that clause-3 of the letter dated 18.05.2017 is not speaking that if the process is not completed within 45 days, no approval will be given by the respondent-JAC. 
 11. In the facts and circumstances of the arguments and the materials on record and looking into the clause-3, it transpires that the letter dated 18.05.2017 whereby the process of advertisement was asked to be initiated by the respondent-JAC, the clause-3, 45 days rider has been provided for completion of the process of appointment. On the query from the Court, the learned counsel for the respondent-JAC fairly submits that there is no statutory provision with regard to 45 days. The learned counsel for the respondent-JAC admitted this position that this is an administrative order. The learned counsel for the respondent nos.6 and 7 disclosed that how 45 days delay has taken place in completion of that process. The 45 days rider cannot be said to be a mandatory one. As sufficient explanation has been given in the counter affidavit by the respondent nos.6 and 7 about 4 days delay in the selection process, the selection process has already taken place and the entire exercise cannot be allowed to be annulled only on the ground that it has been completed after 4 days of rider which is made as 45 days. The 45 days rider is not statutory and not mandatory. The petitioners were already provided the appointment letters and that is why the petitioners have approached this Court in the nature of mandamus. The letter dated 12.12.2017 as contained in Annexure-H to the counter affidavit on which much reliance has been placed by the learned counsel for the respondent-JAC has not been communicated to the petitioners and that is why it has not been challenged by the petitioners. The letter dated 12.12.2017 has been passed on the strength of clause-3 of letter dated 18.05.2017. The Court8finds that there is no mention of the fact that if the process has not completed within 45 days, approval cannot be provided. The right accrued in favour of the petitioners cannot be allowed to be frustrated only for 4 days delay and that too in absence of any statutory provision of completion of procedure within 45 days. It is an admitted position that rider of 45 days is administrative in nature. This Court finds that this is a fit case of only a procedural irregularities which can be regularized and in view of the completion of the exercise that too, by way of delay of 4 days, the action of the respondent-JAC is not justified. This Court finds that this is a fit case to apply the ratio of judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of ""ESI Corpn. v. Jardine Henderson Staff Assn."" and ""Brij Bhukan Kalwar and Ors. v. S.D.O. Siwan and Ors."" (supra), and accordingly, the writ petition [W.P.(S) No. 4522 of 2018] stands allowed. 
 12. The respondent-JAC is directed to accrue the approval in favour of the petitioners as the appointment letters have already been issued and the Government has already approved and merely on the ground of 4 days delay, in absence of any statutory provision and mandatory in nature, the same cannot be denied. In view of the fact that the clause-3 is not statutory in nature and the letter dated 12.12.2017 has been issued on the basis of clause-3, the said letter is not coming in the way of the Court to pass any order in the nature of mandamus. 
 13. With the aforesaid observation and direction, the instant writ petition stands allowed and disposed of. 
 14. I.A., if any, also stands disposed of.

 For the Petitioner : Mr. Ajit Kumar, Advocate For the Resp-CCL : Mrs. Rashmi Kumar, Advocate 
 ----- 
 9/07.09.2020. Heard Mr. Ajit Kumar, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner and Mrs. Rashmi Kumar, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent-CCL. 
 2. This writ petition has been heard through Video Conferencing in view of the guidelines of the High Court taking into account the situation arising due to COVID-19 pandemic. None of the parties have complained about any technical snag of audio-video and with their consent this matter2has been heard on merit. 
 3. The petitioner has preferred this writ petition for quashing the letter dated 07.09.2017 contained in Annexure-6 whereby the claim of the petitioner for appointment on compassionate ground has been rejected. 
 4. Mr. Ajit Kumar, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the father of the petitioner was working on the post of Loader and his date of appointment was 18.09.1980, having Employee Code No.11050770, CMPF No.R/30-546. The father of the petitioner was charge sheeted for the reason of continuous absence from duty. The petitioner's father replied the aforesaid charge sheet as he was being treated in the hospital. A departmental proceeding was initiated against the father of the petitioner. The father of the petitioner died on harness on 11.08.2013. 
 5. Mr. Ajit Kumar, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the father of the petitioner let-off in the departmental proceeding by warning which is apparent from the impugned order of rejection. He submits that the petitioner has filed the representation. Mr. Ajit Kumar, the learned counsel for the petitioner assailed the impugned order on the ground that the father of the petitioner was working with the respondent 
 -CCL and in the departmental enquiry, he was let-off by issuing warning and in that view of the matter he was still with the respondent-CCL and even after when he has died the case of the petitioner was required to be considered. He refers to the judgment dated 17.10.2016 of the co- ordinate Bench of this Court in ""Nuri Ekka @ Nuhri Ekka v. M/s Central Coalfields Limited & Ors."" [W.P.(S) No.1400 of 2014], order dated331.03.2016 in ""Ajay Ram v. M/s Central Coalfields Limited and Ors. [W.P.(S) No.3243 of 2014] and the Division Bench judgment dated 20.02.2020 in L.P.A. No.337 of 2016 in case of ""Central Coalfields Limited, Ranchi v. Ajay Ram"". He submits that the case of the petitioner is fully covered in view of the judgments of the High Court. 
 6. Per contra, Mrs. Rashmi Kumar, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent-CCL submits that the date of birth of the petitioner is 23.02.1977 and he made the application on 21.01.2014 and on that date, he was 36 years 10 months and 28 days old and in view of N.C.W.A. Para-9.4.0, which is quoted hereinbelow: 
 9.4.0. Employment to one dependant of a worker who is permanently disabled in his place 
 (i) The disablement of the worker concerned should arise from the injury or disease be of a permanent nature resulting into loss of employment and it should be so certified by the Coal Company concerned, 
 (ii) In case of disablement arising out of general physical debility so certified by the Coal Company, the employee concerned will be eligible for the benefit under this clause if he/she is upto the age of 58 years. 
 The term 'general physical debility' would mean deficiency of a workman due to any disease or other health reason leading to his/her disablement to perform his/her duties regularly and /or efficiently. 
 (iii) The dependant for this purpose means the wife/husband as the case may be, unmarried daughter, son and legally adopted son. If no such direct dependant is available for employment, brother, widowed daughter/widowed daughter-in-law or son-in- 
 law residing with the employee and almost wholly dependent on the earning of the employee may be considered. 
 In so far as female dependants are concerned, their employment would be governed by the provisions of 9.5.0. 
 (iv) The dependants to be considered for employment should be physically fit and suitable for employment and aged not more than 35 years provided that the age limit in case of employment of female spouse would be 45 years as given in Clause 9.5.0. In so far as male spouse is concerned, there would be no age limit regarding provision of employment. 
 7. The maximum age limit is 35 years for consideration and for female the age is 45 years. As the petitioner has already crossed the age and in that view of the matter, the case of the petitioner is not maintainable, however, on the point of co-ordinate Bench judgment relied by the petitioner she conceded that the judgments are there. 
 8. In view of the above facts and considering the submissions of the parties, the Court finds that the impugned order has been passed on the basis of un-authorized absence and the fact that the petitioner's father was not working and certain legal issue has been dealt with in the impugned order, whereas the argument which has been advanced by Mrs. Rashmi Kumar, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent-CCL with regard to date of birth and Clause -IV of Para-9.4.0 of the NCWA is not reflected in the impugned order. It is well settled provision of law that any ground cannot be supplemented by way of filing the counter affidavit5which has not been the ground for rejecting the claim of the petitioner. A reference may be made in the case of ""Mohinder Singh Gill & Ors. v. Chief Election Commissioner"" reported in (1978) 1 SCC 405 and in that view of the matter, the writ petition succeeds as the ground of age is not the ground of rejection of the claim of the petitioner. 
 9. Accordingly, the impugned order dated 07.09.2017 is quashed. 
 10. The matter is remitted back to the respondent-CCL to consider afresh in the light of the observation made hereinabove and pass appropriate order in accordance with rules, regulations and guidelines including considering the case laws relied by the learned counsel for the petitioner within a period of 8 weeks from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this order. 
 11. The writ petition [W.P. (S) No. 2135 of 2018] stands allowed and disposed of with the aforesaid observation and direction.

 For the Petitioner :- Mrs. Rinku Bhakat, Advocate For Union of India :- Mr. Rajiv Sinha, A.S.G.I. 
 ---- 
 2/07.09.2020 Heard Mrs. Rinku Bhakat, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner and Mr. Rajiv Sinha, the learned A.S.G.I appearing on behalf of the respondent-Union of India. 
 2. This writ petition has been heard through Video Conferencing in view of the guidelines of the High Court taking into account the situation arising due to COVID-19 pandemic. None of the parties have complained about any technical snag of audio-video and with their consent this matter has been heard. 
 3. The petitioner has preferred this writ petition for quashing of the order dated 06.08.2020 as contained in Annexure-5 whereby the petitioner has been transferred from NTS 17665M at Military Hospital, Namkum to MH Hisar Company Commander. The further prayer is made for a direction for stay of the said impugned order. 
 4. The petitioner was initially recruited as Jawan on201.04.2010 and thereafter the petitioner was appointed as Lieutenant after being commissioned and recommended to be appointed as Officer under the provision of Short Service Commission. On 18.03.2018, the petitioner was appointed as Lieutenant for five years. The petitioner is being posted as last posting and therefore under the provision of Policy/ Rules/ Guidelines of DGMS, the petitioner should have been given choice of posting that too near his home. 
 5. The learned counsel for the petitioner assailed the impugned order on the ground that the petitioner has received injury and his leg got fractured and for which he was operated. Therefore, the extension of service of the petitioner is not feasible and the petitioner is going to retire in 2 ½ years. She further submits that in view of the policy/ rules/ guidelines as contained in Annexure-1 to the writ petition, the petitioner is entitled to be remained at the present place of posting as the petitioner is going to retire in 2 ½ years. She refers to the Regulation 37 and submits that it is clearly stated in the said Regulation 37 for last tenure postings 2 to 3 years if the vacancy is there the petitioner is entitled for remaining in the present place of posting. She refers to the last paragraph of the said regulation and submits that this regulation says that service commissioned officers serve the organization for a limited period only and hence grant of a last tenure posting will not be considered in their first contractual period. She further submits that the first contractual period of the petitioner is already over and the petitioner's case is fit to be considered under Regulation 37 of the Policy Guidelines. She submits that the petitioner is a young person and he requires to settle in civil side and for that the petitioner has preferred the representation. 
 6. Per contra, Mr. Rajiv Sinha, the learned A.S.G.I appearing on behalf of the respondents, at the outset, submits at Bar, that the application preferred by the petitioner on 06.08.2020 and 07.08.20203have been considered by the competent authority and the request of the petitioner has already been rejected by letter dated 28.08.2020. He further draws the attention of the Court towards Regulation 31 and submits that the application can be considered on the ground mentioned therein whereas the application brought by the petitioner before the authority was on the different ground. For the sake of convenience, Regulation 31 of the Policy Guidelines is quoted hereinbelow: 
 ""Postings on Applications 
 31. Applications from officers for posting will be considered for the following purposes: 
 (a) Posting on compassionate grounds 
 (b) Last tenure postings 
 (c) Extension of tenures 
 (d) Cancellation of postings 
 (e) Deferment of postings"" 
 7. He further refers to Regulation 37 and submits that the regulation is subject to certain riders. He submits that it is required to be considered on case to case basis and it is clearly stated in the regulation that it is not a matter of right. For ready reference, Regulation 37 is quoted hereinbelow: 
 "" Last Tenure Posting 
 37. Officers may apply for the last tenure postings 2 to 3 years before their date of retirement. A viable tenure in the station of choice will be ensured before submission of the same. Applications will be considered subject to availability of vacancy/service requirement. Last tenure posting will neither be combined with present places of posting nor considered to a station where the officer has served in the preceding tenure. Last tenure postings will be considered on a case to case basis and should not be construed as a matter of right. Short Service Commissioned officers serve the organization for a limited period only and hence grant of a last tenure posting will not be4considered in their first contractual period."" 
 8. He further refers to Regulation 39 of the Policy Guidelines and submits that in view of this, requests for cancellation will normally be entertained only in exceptional circumstances. Regulation 39 is quoted hereinbelow : 
 ""Cancellation of postings 
 39. It must be appreciated that postings are issued after due consideration of the org requirements and the offr's personal profile available with this Dte Gen. Cancellations result in disruption of the chain of movement of offrs resulting in avoidable delays and voids. Hence, requests for cancellation will normally be entertained only in exceptional circumstances. If however it is felt that such representations need to be considered in view of any special/peculiar nature of the case arising after issue of the posting order, these may be expeditiously forwarded along with appropriate recommendations. Once the application is regretted by this Directorate General no reconsideration will be done. 
 9. Lastly, he draws the attention of the Court to Annexure-6/1 dated 08.08.2020 which is the representation of the petitioner before the competent authority and submits that in view of the Regulation 31, no ground of that regulation is there and in that view of the matter, the case of the petitioner cannot be considered in view of the rules, regulations and guideline relied by the petitioner. Lastly, he relied in the case of ""Major General J.K. Bansal v. Union of India and Others"" reported in (2005) 7 SCC 227. Paragraph nos. 11 and 12 of the said judgment is quoted hereinbelow: 
 ""11. Similar view has been taken inNational Hydroelectric Power Corpn. Ltd. v. Shri Bhagwan3wherein it has been held that no government servant or employee of a public undertaking has any legal5right to be posted forever at any one particular place since transfer of a particular employee appointed to the class or category of transferable posts from one place to another is not only an incident, but a condition of service, necessary too in public interest and efficiency in public administration. Unless an order of transfer is shown to be an outcome of mala fide exercise of power or stated to be in violation of statutory provisions prohibiting any such transfer, the courts or the tribunals cannot interfere with such orders, as though they were the Appellate Authorities substituting their own decision for that of the management. 
 12. It will be noticed that these decisions have been rendered in the case of civilian employees or those who are working in public sector undertakings. The scope of interference by the courts in regard to members of armed forces is far more limited and narrow. It is for the higher authorities to decide when and where a member of the armed forces should be posted. The courts should be extremely slow in interfering with an order of transfer of such category of persons and unless an exceptionally strong case is made out, no interference should be made."" 
 10. Having heard the learned counsels appearing for the parties and after going through the submissions of the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the respondent-Union of India, the Court finds that Regulation 31 of the Guidelines prescribes certain grounds on which the application can be considered. None of the grounds provided in Regulation 31 is there has been taken by the petitioner for cancellation of his posting. Regulation 37 on which the petitioner has also relied is applicable with certain rider which says that the application will be considered subject to availability of the vacancies and service requirement. The regulation further says that the first tenure posting will neither be combined with the present place of posting nor6considered to a station where the officer has served in the preceding tenure. Regulation 39 says that the requests for cancellation will normally be entertained only in exceptional circumstances. Regulation 37 further provides that it is not a matter of right. The judgment relied by the learned counsel appearing for the respondent-Union of India is applicable in the facts and circumstances of this case. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has considered this aspect of the matter interference by the Court in regard to members of armed forces is limited and narrow, moreover, the petitioner has not make out a case for interference in view of the rules/regulations on which the petitioner has relied also. The Court has perused the Annexure-6/1 which is a representation of the petitioner in which the posting on the ground of his at Regulation 31 is not there. 
 The request of the petitioner has already been rejected as submitted by Mr. Rajiv Sinha, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent-Union of India, at Bar, and as a cumulative effect of the above discussions, the Court comes to a conclusion that no case of interference is made out, and accordingly, the writ petition [W.P.(S) No. 2380 of 2020] stands dismissed.

 which has been held through video conferencing today at 11.00 A.M. They have no complaint in respect to the audio and video clarity and quality. 
 The petitioner is challenging the order dated 18.01.2017, passed in G.R. No. 259 of 2016, whereby the application for discharge of the petitioner was dismissed by the Judicial Magistrate, Jashedpur. 
 Being aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner preferred criminal revision before the Sessions Judge, Jamshedpur being Cr. Revision No. 108 of 2017. Vide order dated 24.02.2018, the Sessions Judge also dismissed the revision application of the petitioner. The petitioner is also aggrieved by the revisional order. 
 Challenging these two orders, the petitioner has approached this Court by filing an application underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The ground for challenging the same is that without obtaining sanction underSection 197Cr.P.C., the court below could not have taken cognizance and could not have directed to frame charge against the petitioner. Counsel for the petitioner submits that since the petitioner is a public servant and working in a Post Office, sanction ought to have been taken before proceeding. He further submits that from the entire allegation, it would be clear that there is no material against this petitioner and it is one Suparna Paul, who is the main accused and cheated the investors. He submits that said Suparna Paul had authority to withdraw the amount and thus, the amount was disbursed to her. He further submits that whether Suparna Paul has misappropriated the entire amount or not, and the said liability cannot be shifted upon the petitioner. 
 Learned A.P.P. opposes the prayer. 
 The allegation in the FIR is that one Suparna Paul, who is the agent, withdrawn money on behalf of the depositors from the post office and thereafter, misappropriated the same. There is allegation against the officials of the Postal Department that they connived with said Suparna-2-Paul and assisted her in withdrawing money. This petitioner is one of the Assistant in the Post Office. 
 While going through both the impugned orders, I find that both the courts below, i.e. the trial court and the revisional court had considered all the aspects and contention raised by the petitioner in detail and passed a detailed order. Why the provision ofSection 197Cr.P.C. would not be applicable, has also been mentioned in the impugned orders. There is allegation of fraud against the petitioner. Fraud is committed in personal capacity and not in official capacity. Thus, there is no application of Section 197 Cr.P.C. 
 Since, there is no irregularity, illegality and perversity in the impugned orders, I am not inclined to exercise my jurisdiction underSection 482Cr.P.C. where there is concurrent finding of both the courts below. Thus, this application stands dimissed.

 The petitioner is challenging the order dated 18.01.2017, passed in G.R. No. 259 of 2016, whereby the application for discharge of the petitioner was dismissed by the Judicial Magistrate, Jashedpur. 
 Being aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner preferred criminal revision before the Sessions Judge, Jamshedpur being Cr. Revision No. 108 of 2017. Vide order dated 24.02.2018, the Sessions Judge also dismissed the revision application of the petitioner. The petitioner is also aggrieved by the revisional order. 
 Challenging these two orders, the petitioner has approached this Court by filing an application underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The ground for challenging the same is that without obtaining sanction underSection 197Cr.P.C., the court below could not have taken cognizance and could not have directed to frame charge against the petitioner. Counsel for the petitioner submits that since the petitioner is a public servant and working in a Post Office, sanction ought to have been taken before proceeding. He further submits that from the entire allegation, it would be clear that there is no material against this petitioner and it is one Suparna Paul, who is the main accused and cheated the investors. He submits that said Suparna Paul had authority to withdraw the amount and thus, the amount was disbursed to her. He further submits that whether Suparna Paul has misappropriated the entire amount or not, and the said liability cannot be shifted upon the petitioner. 
 Learned A.P.P. opposes the prayer. 
 The allegation in the FIR is that one Suparna Paul, who is the agent, withdrawn money on behalf of the depositors from the post office and thereafter, misappropriated the same. There is allegation against the officials of the Postal Department that they connived with said Suparna-2-Paul and assisted her in withdrawing money. This petitioner is one of the Assistant in the Post Office. 
 While going through both the impugned orders, I find that both the courts below, i.e. the trial court and the revisional court had considered all the aspects and contention raised by the petitioner in detail and passed a detailed order. Why the provision ofSection 197Cr.P.C. would not be applicable, has also been mentioned in the impugned orders. There is allegation of fraud against the petitioner. Fraud is committed in personal capacity and not in official capacity. Thus, there is no application of Section 197 Cr.P.C. 
 Since, there is no irregularity, illegality and perversity in the impugned orders, I am not inclined to exercise my jurisdiction underSection 482Cr.P.C. where there is concurrent finding of both the courts below. Thus, this application stands dimissed.

Thus, this case is listed today before this Court directly.

 With the consent of the parties, the matter is taken up for hearing on merits. 
 Heard the parties. 
 The petitioners are aggrieved by the order dated 19.09.2019, by which the court has taken cognizance for the offence punishable underSections 323,504IPC and, thereafter, issued summon to the petitioners. 
 Mr. Nilesh Kumar, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that final report was submitted in favour of the petitioners but the court differed with the final report and had taken cognizance. He submits that the order is absolutely bad and cryptic and there is nothing to suggest as to what are the materials against the petitioners. He submits that the court has not even mentioned the reasons and the grounds for differing with the police report. 
 After going through the impugned order, I find much substance in-2-the submission of Mr. Nilesh Kumar, learned counsel for the petitioners. The court below in a most mechanical manner differed with the police report. The court has not even given the reason as to why he is differing with the police report. Merely writing one line that there are sufficient materials, is not enough to suggest that mind has been applied. Further, I find that nothing has been mentioned in the impugned order as to what are the materials to issue summon against this petitioner. Thus, the order dated 19.09.2019 is liable to be set aside. 
 Thus, in view of the order passed by this Court in the case of ""Amresh Kumar Dhiraj & Ors.- versus- State of Jharkhand & Anr, reported in 2020 (1) JLJR 199"", this application is allowed. The impugned order dated 19.09.2019, passed in G.R. Case No. 1549 of 2019, is, hereby, set aside. The matter is remitted to the Court below to pass a fresh order in accordance with the provisions of law.

 Heard Mr. Chandrajeet Mukherjee, learned counsel for the petitioner, at length. 
 The petitioner being the complaint is aggrieved by the part of the order dated 25.09.2018, wherein cognizance has been taken and summon has been issued. 
 Counsel for the petitioner submits that cognizance has not been taken under the provision of Scheduled Castes andScheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, though there are sufficient materials to take cognizance. He further submits that some of the persons, whose name figured in the complaint have not been summoned. He prays that the court below be directed to take cognizance under the provisions of Scheduled Castes andScheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Actand be also be-2-directed to issued summon against all the persons named as accused. 
 I think that the prayer made by the petitioner, in this application, filed underSection 482Cr.P.C., is unfounded. There are remedies available to the petitioner in Cr. P.C. If during trial any material comes against the persons, those who have not been summoned, the petitioner can very well invoke the provision ofCr.P.C. Further, the charge at any point of time can be altered. The petitioner can also take all these pointes at the time of framing of charge. 
 Considering aforesaid position of law, I am not inclined to entertain this application at this stage. Thus, the same is hereby dismissed. However, the liberty is reserved with the petitioner.

 Considering the pandemic situation where the court has minimized the footfall of the lawyers and their clerks in the court, this court felt proper to get all the cases listed before this Court so that the defect(s) can be looked into at this stage only. Thus, this case is listed today before this Court directly. 
 With the consent of the parties, the matter is taken up for hearing on merits. Defect(s) as pointed out by the office, if any, is ignored for the present. In this application, petitioner has prayed to quash the order dated 5.03.2018 by which cognizance of the offence punishable underSection 406,420and120(B)IPC has been taken. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the cognizance order is absolutely bad and is a non-speaking order and it does not reflect any subjective satisfaction as to what are the materials to take cognizance against this petitioner. He submits that the requirements ofSections 190&204Cr.P.C has not been dealt with in the impugned order. He is relying upon the judgment of this Court in the case of Amresh Kumar Dhiraj and Ors. Vs. State of Jharkhand &Anr., reported in 2020 (1) JLJR 199. 
 After going through the record, I find that the order is absolutely cryptic and non-speaking and is not in conformity with the judgment passed by this Court in the case of Amresh Kumar Dhiraj and Ors. Vs. State of Jharkhand &Anr., reported in 2020 (1) JLJR 199. What are the materials against the petitioner to proceed, has also not been mentioned.

 which has been held through video conferencing today at 11.00 A.M. They have no complaint in respect to the audio and video clarity and quality. 
 This case was listed/ supposed to be listed before the Lawazima Board of the Registrar General for passing an order in respect of the defects, pointed out by the office. 
 Considering the pandemic situation where the Court has minimized the footfall of the lawyers and their Clerks in the Court, this court felt proper to get all the cases listed before this Court so that the defects can be looked into at this stage only. Thus, this case is listed today before this Court directly. 
 There are several defects and one of the defects is in respect of the deficit court fee. 
 Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner undertakes to deposit the deficit court fee within two weeks from today. Rest of the defects stand ignored for the present. 
 With the consent of the parties, the matter is taken up for hearing on merits. 
 Petitioner is confining his prayer only to the order dated 01.10.2013 and 01.08.2014, by which processes underSections 82Cr.P.C. and attachment order in terms ofSection 83Cr.P.C. respectively, has been issued against him. 
 After going through the orders, I find that on 01.10.2013, process underSection 82Cr.P.C. has been issued without waiting for service report of non-bailable warrant of arrest. Only in one line the order has been passed that since the petitioner is absent, O/C to issue 82Cr.P.C. Thus, the order is not only cryptic but also bad in law as the conditions specified underSection 82Cr.P.C. have not been fulfilled. 
 Similar is the situation with the order dated 01.08.2014, issuing process underSection 83Cr.P.C. No subjective satisfaction has been-2-reflected in both the orders. 
 Thus, I am inclined to allow this criminal miscellaneous petition. Accordingly, the same is hereby allowed. The impugned orders dated 01.10.2013 & 01.08.2014, by which processes underSections 82&83of the Code of Criminal Procedure have been issued, are hereby set aside. The matter is remitted to the court below to pass a fresh order in accordance with law. 
 This criminal miscellaneous petition stands allowed.

 Order No.04 Date: 07.09.2020 
 1. This case is taken up through video conferencing. 
 2. The present writ petition has been filed for issuance of direction upon the respondent nos.3 and 4 to take decision on the representation of the petitioner with regard to error committed in evaluation of answer script with respect to Course Code- ES 222, Programme Code- DPE, having Enrolment no.054809336, which was held in the month of December, 2018. The petitioner is also aggrieved by non-publication of her result with respect to Course Code- ES 222, Programme Code- DPE, the examination of which was held on 29th June, 2019. 
 3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that in the month of June, 2005, the petitioner got herself enrolled for pursuing Diploma in Primary Education (in short 'DPE') programme under respondent no.2- Indira Gandhi National Open University, which is an open university, established under the Indira Gandhi National Open University Act, 1985 (hereinafter to be referred as 'the Act, 1985'). The petitioner passed in all subjects required under DPE programme except Course Code ES-221 and ES-222 within the validity period. The petitioner took readmission in DPE programme on 3rd November, 2017 and passed in Course Code ES-221, however, she could not pass in Course Code-2-ES-222. The petitioner again appeared in the examination held on 29th December, 2018 in connection with Course Code ES-222, but she was given overall grade marks 'E', which indicated that she could not pass the said subject. She applied under Right toInformation Act, 2005 for obtaining the photo copy of the answering script of the said course code and the same was provided to her on 21st May, 2019. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that on perusal of the answer scripts, the copies of which have been annexed as Annexure-2 series to the writ petition, it would be evident that there had been a gross error in evaluation of the answer script of Course Code ES-222. Nonetheless, the petitioner after obtaining permission again appeared in the examination on 29th June, 2019 for Course Code Es-222 under DPE programme on depositing examination fee, but her result for the said course code was not declared by the respondents. On this occasion also, the petitioner obtained the answer script of examination dated 29th June, 2019 under Right toInformation Act, 2005, from which she could know that she had secured grade marks 'C' in the said course code, indicating that she was declared pass but her result was not declared. Subsequently, on 13th November, 2019 the petitioner came to know through the website of IGNOU that her result was not published with remarks- ""Readmission Not Done"". Since the petitioner had appeared in the examination conducted on 29th June, 2019 for the Course Code ES-222 after taking due permission on depositing the fee and her answer sheet was also evaluated, non-publication of her result is highly arbitrary. The petitioner represented before the respondent nos.3 and 4 on 18th November, 2019, requesting, inter alia, to publish her result for the said course code, however, no decision was taken by the respondent nos.3 and 4 in this regard, which compelled the petitioner to file the present writ petition. 
 4. Heard learned counsel for the parties. Statute 7(2)(l) of the Statutes of the University under Second Schedule prepared in terms withSection 24of the Act, 1985 empowers the Board of Management of IGNOU to entertain and adjudicate upon or redress the grievances of the employees and the students of the University who may for any reason feel aggrieved. 
 5. Hence, without entering into the merit of the grievance raised in the present writ petition, the petitioner is given liberty to file a fresh representation before the Registrar-cum-Secretary, Board of Management, Indira Gandhi National Open University, Delhi- respondent no.4 through e-mail. On receipt of the said representation, the respondent no.4 shall place the aforesaid grievance of the petitioner before the Board of Management, IGNOU within a period of two weeks from the date of receipt of the said representation and the said Board of Management shall take appropriate decision in accordance with law within a period of eight weeks thereafter. The decision taken by the Board of Management shall duly be communicated to the petitioner within a period of one week thereafter. 
 6. The writ petition is, accordingly, disposed of with the aforesaid liberty and directions.

 4/ 07.09.2020 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned counsel for the State through Video Conferencing. The lawyers have no objection with regard to the proceeding, which has been held through Video Conferencing today at 11.00 a.m. They have no complain in respect to the audio and video clarity and quality. 
 This case was listed/supposed to be listed before the Lawazima Board of the Registrar General for seeking an order in respect of the defects, pointed out by the Office. 
 Considering the pandemic situation where the Court has minimized the footfall of the lawyers and their Clerks in the Court, this Court felt proper to get all the cases listed before this Court so that the defects can be looked into at this stage only. Thus, this case is listed today before this Court directly. 
 The defects stand ignored for the present. 
 With the consent of the parties, the matter is taken up for hearing on merits. 
 Earlier the petitioner had challenged the revisional order dated 2.7.2019 by which the revisional Court being Court of Principal Sessions Judge, Giridih has dismissed the criminal revision (Cr. Rev. No.83 of 2019) challenging the order passed by the Magistrate, whereby processes underSection 82of the Code of Criminal Procedure was issued. 
 Since the Revisional Court in Criminal Revision No.83 of 2019 did not find the order issuing processes underSection 82of the Code of Criminal Procedure to be in accordance with law or not, matter was remitted by this Court to the Revisional Court. The Revisional Court has again passed the order dated 07.01.2020, though the Court has himself played the role of Magistrate deciding as to whether there was any material to issue processes underSection 82of the Code of Criminal Procedure or not, yet, I am not inclined to entertain this criminal miscellaneous petition, as the Revisional-: 2 :-Court, after going through the materials on record, has considered that notices were issued upon the petitioner, but, he refused to accept. The dates have also been mentioned in the impugned order as to when the petitioner refused to accept the notices underSection 41of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This suggests that the petitioner was evading his arrest. Thus, I am not inclined to entertain this criminal miscellaneous petition exercising my jurisdiction underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 This criminal miscellaneous petition, accordingly, stands dismissed.

Thus, this case is listed today before this Court directly. 
 There are several defects and one of the defects is in respect to the deficit court fee. 
 Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner undertakes to deposit the deficit court fee within two weeks from today. Rest of the defects stand ignored for the present.

 Heard the parties. 
 The petitioner is challenging the order dated 22.11.2018, passed in Complaint Case No. 287 of 2018, by which the petitioner has been summoned after taking cognizance of the offence punishable underSections 9/51of Wild Life Protection Act andSection 33of the Indian Forest Act andIndian Forest Amendment Act1989(Bihar Amendment Act9/1990) . 
 From the impugned order, I find that nothing has been mentioned as to what material attracts the offence so far as this petitioner is concerned. What is the overt act, has also not been mentioned in the impugned order. Without applying his mind, the court has issued summon to this petitioner. In terms ofSection 204Cr.P.C., the court has to be-2-satisfied as to what are the materials against the accused to proceed against. This Court in the case of ""Amresh Kumar Dhiraj & Ors.- versus- State of Jharkhand & Anr, reported in 2020 (1) JLJR 199"", has held that what are the prima- facie material against the accused at least should be reflected in the impugned order. The impugned order is absolutely cryptic. 
 In view of the aforesaid facts, I find that the order dated 22.11.2018 is not in consonance with the provisions as laid down, thus, this application stands allowed. The impugned order dated 22.11.2018, passed in Complaint Case No. 287 of 2018 is, hereby, set aside.

It is well settled principle of law that when cognizable offence is made out and the facts, which needs to be investigated are present, the FIR cannot be quashed. This case relates to double murder.

 I.A. No. 291 of 2020 5/ 07.09.2020 Heard learned counsel for the appellant and the learned counsel for the State on the interlocutory application filed by the appellant for granting bail during the pendency of this appeal. 
 The appellant has been convicted and sentenced for the offences underSection 376of the Indian Penal Code and Section 4 of the POCSO Act. 
 Though the victim girl has supported the prosecution case in her examination-in-chief, but in her cross-examination, she has stated that no wrong was committed with her. From the evidence on record, it also appears that the appellant was the landlord of the victim and there was some rent dispute between them. In the medical evidence, no sign of sexual intercourse was found in the recent past. The appellant was also on bail during the pendency of the trial. 
 In the facts of this case, we are inclined to release the appellant, Shankar Prasad, on bail. Accordingly, the appellant, named above, is directed to be released on bail, during the pendency of this appeal, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- (ten thousand), with two sureties of the like amount each, to the satisfaction of learned Addl. Sessions Judge-I cum Special Judge POCSO, Latehar, in connection with Special POCSO Case No. 11 of 2016. 
 The aforesaid interlocutory application is accordingly, allowed.

 Defects as pointed out by the office are ignored. Petitioners are accused in connection with Tongra P.S. Case No. 6 of 2020. 
 The petitioners were suspected to have enticed away the sister of the informant. In the statement underSection 164Cr.P.C. of the victim, she has stated that she was having a love affair with Jay Gopal Pal. However, her parents refused to get her marriage solemnize with him and on 23.02.2020, she has eloped with Jay Gopal Pal and had gone to Durgapur. The petitioners are attributed to have given the proposal of marriage of victim and Jay Gopal Pal. It appears that the victim was recovered from the custody of petitioner no. 2 and Jay Gopal Pal. 
 Since the entire allegation centres around Jay Gopal Pal, I am inclined to grant bail to the present petitioners. 
 Regard being had to the above, the petitioners above named are directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each, to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate 1st class, Dumka in connection with Tongra P.S.

 It has been alleged that the petitioner had sexually exploited the informant for the last six years on the pretext of marriage. He however later on denied to solemnize marriage. 
 In the 164Cr.P.C. statement of the victim, she has stated that she was having a love affair with the petitioner for the last six years.

She has further stated that the petitioner does not want to keep her and therefore she has lodged the case. The petitioner appears to be in custody since 08.05.2020.

 C.A.V. on 27/08/2020 Pronounced on 08/09/2020 Rajesh Kumar, J.:- Heard the appellant-in-person and learned counsel for the respondent wife. 
 2. The present appeal has been filed by the husband- appellant/plaintiff against the Judgment dated 05.10.2018 and Decree of dismissal dated 28.11.2018 passed in Original Suit No.174 of 2016 by the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Giridih. 
 3. The suit has been instituted by the husband for divorce underSection 13of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 on the ground of cruelty, desertion and mental incapacity of the respondent-wife. 
 4. The Trial Court after considering the pleading of the parties has formulated six issues for decision, which are as follows:- 
 ¼1½ D;k oknh dk okn iks""k.kh; gS \ ¼2½ D;k bl okn esa okn&dkj.k gS \ ¼3½ D;k izfrokfnuh us oknh ds lkFk Øwjrk fd;k gS \ ¼4½ D;k izfrokfnuh us yxkrkj nks o""kksZ ls vf/kd le; ls oknh dk vfHkR;kx dj fn;k fn;k gS \ ¼5½ D;k oknh fookg&foPNsn dk fMØh ikus dk gdnkj gS \ ¼6½ D;k oknh fdlh vU; vuqrks""k ;k vuqrks""kksa dks ikus dk gdnkj gS \ F.A.

 5. After analyzing the evidences, pleadings and argument of the parties all the issues have been decided against the plaintiff- husband and in favour of the wife-respondent vide impugned Judgment dated 05.10.2018 and accordingly decree has been drawn and signed on 28.11.2018. 
 6. Being aggrieved, the present appeal has been filed by the appellant-husband and vide order dated 24.09.2019, delay in filing the appeal has been condoned. It may be stated that in course of trial as well as during the pendency of the appeal, efforts of mediation were made between the parties, but all the efforts failed. Even during the final hearing of the appeal, efforts of compromise were made by us, but there could be no compromise between the parties. Hence we have heard this appeal on merits. 
 7. Before this Court, the appellant-husband has taken two points i.e. cruelty and desertion. Mental disability of the respondent- wife has not been pressed. It is worth to note that the court below has rejected the ground of mental illness as no evidence had been led by the appellant-husband. 
 8. Considering the pleadings and arguments and material available on record, two points are required to be considered by this Court. 
 (i). Whether the respondent-wife has treated the appellant-husband with cruelty warranting dissolution of marriage. 
 (ii). Whether residing separately by wife since 12.07.2014 amounts to desertion entitling husband for decree of divorce as per the mandate ofSection 13(i-b) of theHindu Marriage Act, 1955. 
 9. As per the pleadings of the husband, marriage had been solemnized between the parties as per Hindu rites and rituals at Mirzaganj on 29.01.2007 in presence of relatives and family members of both the parties and they have lived as husband and wife at Ranchi and Delhi. One son and one daughter have been born out from their wedlock. As per appellant- husband, the respondent-wife always behaved in a psychic and rude manner with the appellant-husband and also with his parents and has treated him as well as his parents with F.A. No. 47 of 2019-3-utmost cruelty in different ways. The appellant-husband was considerate and treated his wife with compassion and tolerated her cruelty giving her time to mend her ways and even he allowed his brother-in-law, namely Dinesh Kumar to live in their matrimonial home at Ranchi in 2007-2008 to pursue his graduation course and on successful completion of course he got job in Insurance Company. Appellant-husband even encouraged his wife for higher studies and accordingly she got admitted in M.A. (History) in Ranchi University in June, 2007 but she did not pursue her course. Thereafter even she was admitted in Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) for M.A. (English), but in vein. In 2008, appellant-husband had searched a job in English Nursery School as per her educational qualification, but she refused to work. Just after one year of marriage, the appellant- husband had taken his wife to marriage ceremony of her cousin sister, namely, Poonam at Mirzaganj and on completion of the rituals, he informed her parents regarding the cruel and rude behavior of his wife. After coming back, her behavior became ruder. Ultimately, she conceived and gave birth to a healthy male child. Even after birth of the child, her behavior did not improve and after 20 days of birth she had been taken to her parents' place by his father-in-law for better care of child. Due to the behavior pattern of his wife and her family members, appellant apprehended and accordingly he filed an Informatory Petition in the court of C.J.M., Giridih apprehending filing of false case against him and his family members for dowry and domestic violence and requested the learned C.J.M., Giridih to send the above mentioned Informatory Petition to Jamua Police Station and Tisri Police Station with a direction to take necessary, preventive and protective action so that no false case be instituted. 
 10. Thereafter, appellant moved to Delhi where he got job in AIIMS. Appellant was desirous to bring his wife to Delhi but in the meantime she moved to Giridih Tailik Sahu Sabha who held panchayati on 08.11.2009 and as per dictum of panchayat, she went to Delhi alongwith her husband where she resided for few months. Appellant-husband wanted to bring his father to Delhi for treatment which was refused by his wife and accordingly he died on 11.05.2010 F.A. No. 47 of 2019-4-due to lack of proper care and treatment. In spite of death of his father, he attended the marriage ceremony of his brother-in-law, which was held on 05.06.2010 at Mirzaganj and performed necessary rituals. Suddenly after marriage of her brother, namely Rupesh Kumar, she came to Delhi without information on 28.06.2010 and called the appellant in the morning at 7.00 A.M, when he had gone for a breakfast in AIIMS canteen. He informed his wife to remain calm as he will come and open the gate of the residence but she called the police and created a scene. As appellant was getting threats, he again filed an application dated 10.06.2010 in the office of S.P., Giridih. 
 11. The respondent-wife again went to her parents' place on 07.09.2010. When he went there to meet his wife and son, he was not allowed to meet his wife and son in October, 2010 and January, 2011, which amounts to cruelty. She further lodged an F.I.R. as Tisri P.S. Case No.38 of 2011 dated 12.05.2011 underSection 498A/34of the Indian Penal Code and 3/4 of theDowry Prohibition Act. Compromise had been arrived between the parties and on that basis he got bail. That case is still pending for trial, and in spite of the fact that final form had been submitted, still the C.J.M, Giridih has taken cognizance in the case. As per the compromise, they again started living as husband and wife but cruelty of the respondent-wife became more intense and psychic behavior endangering the life of appellant as well as his son. In the meantime, respondent-wife again became pregnant and one day she left for her parents' place but appellant-husband took her back from the railway station but ultimately with her maternal uncle, namely, Praween Kumar, she went to her parents' place on 03.07.2012. Appellant came to know from the independent source in July-August, 2012 that she got the fetus aborted. The appellant ultimately got job at Ranchi and as per desire of his wife, they again started living as husband and wife from November December, 2012 but behavior of respondent-wife did not improve. She used to threat him with suicide and has treated the appellant-husband with cruelty and sometimes not allowed to enter the house if he got delayed due to pressure of work. She used to bolt the house from inside due to her psychic behavior. One day when they were returning after visiting a F.A. No. 47 of 2019-5-park she jumped from the car and ran towards the car on trivial issue. Again she became pregnant and ultimately blessed with a female child in 2014. One day he had been assaulted by the brother-in-law for which he complained to Bariatu police station but subsequently he withdrew the application but his wife has lodged a false criminal case underSection 498Aof the Indian Penal Code against the appellant- husband in Bariatu police station and ultimately she left the matrimonial house on 12.07.2014 out of her own will and since then they are living separately and this amounts to desertion. 
 12. On 02.08.2014 a maintenance case being M.T.S. Case No.232 of 2014 has been filed in which vide order dated 29.11.2016, appellant-husband has been directed to pay Rs.25,000/- as maintenance i.e. Rs.15,000/- for wife and Rs.5,000/- each for two children. (However, it has been admitted in course of argument that for about 11 months payment has not been made.) 
 13. In support of his pleadings, the appellant-husband has not produced any documentary evidence, but has examined two witnesses, one himself and his mother, namely, Kaushalya Devi. 
 14. Respondent-wife has filed written statement denying the allegation of cruelty, desertion and mental illness. It has been alleged that demand of dowry of Rs.2,00,000/- and a car could not be given to appellant-husband and for extracting the same, respondent-wife had been treated with cruelty and time to time, she had been ousted from her matrimonial house. She has admitted that they had lived as husband and wife at Ranchi and at Delhi. After birth of male child she went to her parents' place but appellant-husband was not willing to take her back and as such she approached the Tailik Sahu Sabha and panchayati was held on 08.11.2009 and as per dictum of the panchayat she was taken back to the matrimonial home. She has denied that she has ever refuted for treatment of father of the husband rather she has performed her duty towards parents of the appellant-husband. She has further stated that as appellant-husband was harassing her for demand of dowry and as such an FIR being Tisri P.S. Case No.38 of 2011 has been instituted on 12.05.2011 underSection 498Aof the IPC andSection 3/4of the Dowry Prohibition Act in which the wife readily F.A. No. 47 of 2019-6-accepted the compromise to save her marriage upon which as per the terms and condition of the bail order, she was taken to the matrimonial home. When she went to attend marriage of her brother and after completion of marriage ceremony, appellant- husband came alone and was not willing to take her back and as such she went to Delhi alongwith her brother. To avoid the entry, husband locked the house and went to the work place. Even after persuasion, when her husband did not turn up, she had to get the help of Delhi police and upon intervention of Delhi police a compromise had been arrived between the parties and she had been allowed to enter into the matrimonial home at Delhi. Even at Ranchi, she was always mistreated and pressurized for bringing dowry or doing job. Ultimately, she had to approach Bariatu police station by lodging Bariatu police case No.429 of 2013 underSections 498Aand323of the IPC in which also she readily compromised. In spite of compromise, she was driven out of matrimonial home on 12.07.2014 and since then she has not been allowed to enter the matrimonial home, although she is always desirous to save the matrimonial home and has participated in the marriage of younger brother of her husband on 07.05.2017 at his village. 
 15. In support of her pleading, she has examined four witness, namely, Ashok Saw, Naresh Saw, Praveen Kumar and herself. She has also produced documentary evidence i.e. Exhibit-A, a mutual divorce application dated 13.07.2009 sent by the husband to wife after signing. Exhibit-B, letter dated 30.07.2010 to her father giving threat. Exhibit-C, Formal FIR of Tisri P.S. Case No.38 of 2011. Exhibit-D, certified copy of the Charge-sheet of Tisri P.S Case No.38 of 2011. Exhibit D/a, certified copy of the charge-sheet of Bariatu P.S. Case No.429 of 2013. Exhibit-E, certified copy of the order of framing of charge of Tisri P.S. Case No. 38 of 2011, Exhibit-F, certified copy of the compromise between the parties in Tisri P.S. Exhibit-G, certified copy of the order dated 21.01.2012 in Tisri P.S. Case No. 38 of 2011, Exhibit-G/a, certified copy of the order-sheet of A.B.P. Case No. 256 of 2011. Xerox copies of Panchnama of Tailik Sahu Sabha F.A. No. 47 of 2019-7-and information given by the wife-Suman Kumari to Delhi police were marked as 'X' and 'Y' for identification. 
 16. The appellant-in-person has submitted that the impugned Judgement and Decree passed by the court below are absolutely illegal and against the evidence on record. It is submitted that on the basis of the evidence on record, the cruelty of the respondent wife is proved by him. It is also submitted that admittedly the respondent wife has filed multiple criminal cases against him, in which the appellant had to undergo jail, which in itself amounts to cruelty by the respondent wife, thus entitling the appellant to the decree of divorce. In any event, the desertion since 12.07.2014 is an admitted fact and this alone gives a good ground for divorce. It is further submitted by the appellant-in- person that in spite of the desertion for more than six years, no case for restitution of the conjugal rights has been filed by the respondent wife, which shows that desertion is voluntary on her part as well. He has further submitted that there is irretrievable breakdown of marriage between the parties, and on this ground also, the decree of divorce should have been passed. 
 17. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent wife has submitted that the court below has discussed the evidence of both the sides in detail and has rightly decided all the issues against the appellant and in favour of the respondent wife. As such, there is no illegality in the impugned Judgement and Decree passed by the court below, and this appeal is fit to be dismissed. Learned counsel has submitted that the respondent is still willing to lead a respectable conjugal life with her husband, but the husband is not willing to keep her. 
 18. Having heard the appellant-in-person and learned counsel for the respondent wife, we find that so far as first point raised by the appellant regarding cruelty, it appears from the pleading of the plaintiff-husband himself that he has given bald and sweeping statements without providing any cogent documentary proof of the same. There is only oral evidence of the appellant and her mother, but the oral evidence adduced by the respondent wife in support of her pleadings, are also supported by documentary evidence, which F.A. No. 47 of 2019-8-demolish the case of cruelty, as pleaded by the husband, rather it supports the case of the respondent wife that actually she was treated with cruelty and torture by the appellant. Merely filing of criminal cases by the respondent wife cannot be treated to be cruel behavior on her part, unless the allegations made by her are proved to be false, which is not the case till date, as the trial in the criminal cases are still pending. Indeed the compromises by her in order to secure bail for the appellant in the criminal cases, clearly indicate the willingness of the respondent wife to resume the respectable conjugal life with the appellant. None filing of any case for restitution of the conjugal rights by the respondent wife, cannot mean that she is also interested in living separate from her husband, rather the facts of this case show that she has been compelled by the husband himself to leave the matrimonial house. As regards contention of the appellant that the marriage between him and the respondent has irretrievably broken down, we still hope that good sense shall prevail over the appellant, keeping in view the fact that he has two children out of this wedlock, and he shall not allow their future to be compromised due to differences between him and his wife. At the place of taking the extreme step of annulling the marriage between them, we would prefer to give more time to the appellant to ponder over future of his children and to reunite his family for a blissful living together. We are also conscious of the fact that irretrievable breakdown of marriage is still not a ground for dissolution of marriage underSection 13of the Hindu Marriage Act, even though way back in the year 1985, the Apex Court in Jorden Diengdeh Vs. S.S. Chopra, reported in (1985) 3 SCC 62, expressed its views as follows:- 
 ""7. It is thus seen that the law relating to judicial separation, divorce and nullity of marriage is far, far from uniform. Surely the time has now come for a complete reform of the law of marriage and make a uniform law applicable to all people irrespective of religion or caste. It appears to be necessary to introduce irretrievable breakdown of marriage and mutual consent as grounds of divorce in all cases. The case before us is an illustration of a case where the parties are bound together by a marital tie which is better untied. There is no point or purpose to be served by the continuance of a marriage which has so F.A. No. 47 of 2019-9-completely and signally broken down. We suggest that the time has come for the intervention of the legislature in these matters to provide for a uniform code of marriage and divorce and to provide by law for a way out of the unhappy situations in which couples like the present have found themselves in. We direct that a copy of this order may be forwarded to the Ministry of Law and Justice for such action as they may deem fit to take. In the mean while, let notice go to the respondents."" 
 19. From pleading of the parties and the evidence on record, it appears that the husband wants to get rid of his wife as it is evident from Exhibit-A, i.e., petition for mutual divorce which has been sent to the wife after signing by the husband. Exhibit-B, letter dated 30.07.2010 which has been sent to the father-in-law by the husband also suggests that he wants to get rid of his wife by hook and crook. Lord Denning, L.J. in Kaslefsky v. Kaslefsky [(1950)] 2 All ER 398; 403] observed as under: 
 ""If the door of cruelty were opened too wide, we should soon find ourselves granting divorce for incompatibility of temperament. This is an easy path to tread, especially in undefended cases. The temptation must be resisted lest we slip into a state of affairs where the institution of marriage itself is imperiled."" 
 20. Be that as it may, the allegation of cruelty as alleged by the husband has not been proved by placing any cogent evidence on record and as such this ground has to fail and accordingly this point has been decided in favour of the respondent-wife and against the appellant-husband, which we hereby, affirm. 
 21. So far as point of desertion is concerned, it is admitted position between the parties that they are living separately since 12.07.2014. The argument of the appellant-husband is that living separately itself is sufficient in the eyes of law for granting divorce, which is not acceptable.Section 13(1)(i-b) of theHindu Marriage Act, is quoted hereinunder:- 
 ""(ib) has deserted the petitioner for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition; or *** *** *** F.A. No. 47 of 2019 
 - 10 - 
 Explanation. --In this sub-section, the expression ""desertion"" means the desertion of the petitioner by the other party to the marriage without reasonable cause and without the consent or against the wish of such party, and includes the wilful neglect of the petitioner by the other party to the marriage, and its grammatical variations and cognate expressions shall be construed accordingly. 
 22. From perusal of the above section, it is evident that command of law is clear that desertion has to be voluntary. In the present case, the wife has been driven out of her matrimonial home and she is still willing to live in her matrimonial home as it is evident from the fact that she has participated in the marriage of younger brother of her husband on 07.05.2017 at village of her husband and the compromises by her in the criminal cases in order to secure bail for the appellant. Further the entire sequence of fact suggests that husband is desirous to get rid of his wife and on so many occasions, he had to take her back only after compromise and on the dictum of panchayati. 
 23. It is also settled principle of law that nobody can take benefit of his own fault. If the contention of the appellant-husband is accepted then the very purpose of the law will be defeated. Any husband desirous to get rid of his wife may get desired result by driving out his wife from matrimonial home by force or creating a situation and thereafter taking plea of desertion for more than two years. The law is clear that if one of the parties to the matrimonial home, voluntary and without any plausible explanation has left the matrimonial home giving no option to the other party, then it amounts to desertion. Desertion is a willful and voluntary act by the party to leave something without any rational reason. In the present case, husband is at fault and this is the reason for separate living of both the parties. 
 24. In view of the finding recorded by us, the appellant- husband is not entitled for decree of divorce on the ground of desertion for more than two years. 
 25. As both the points have been decided against the appellant-husband, the appeal fails and accordingly it is dismissed. The Judgment dated 05.10.2018 and Decree of dismissal dated F.A. No. 47 of 2019 
 - 11 - 
 28.11.2018 passed in Original Suit No.174 of 2016 by Principal Judge Family Court, Giridih, are, hereby, affirmed. 
 26. Office is directed to prepare the decree accordingly. 
 27. In the facts of the present case and considering the conduct of the parties it is held that wife is entitled for cost of litigation which is quantified to Rs.20,000/- (Twenty Thousand), which must be paid within two months from the date of the decree. 
 28. With above observations and directions, the present appeal is, hereby, dismissed.

 which has been held through video conferencing today at 10.30 A.M. They have no complaint in respect to the audio and video clarity and quality. 
 2. Heard learned counsel for the parties. 
 3. The petitioners, in this application, filed underSection 482Cr.P.C., have prayed for quashing the order taking cognizance dated 15.06.2015, passed by the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Jamshedpur in G.R. No. 950 of 2014. By virtue of the aforesaid order, cognizance has been taken for the offence punishable underSections 406,409,420,467,468&471of the Indian Penal Code. Further the order dated 27.04.2018, passed in the aforesaid case has also been challenged. By virtue of the aforesaid order, process underSection 82Cr.P.C. has been issued against the petitioners in connection with the aforementioned case. 
 4. This case arises out of a FIR. The FIR was registered for allegedly committing an offence punishable underSections 420,467,468&471of the Indian Penal Code, wherein these two petitioners are the accused. 
 5. FIR was registered as Bishtupur P.S. Case No. 113 of 2014. The informant is the Branch Manager of the Central Bank of India, TISCO Gate Branch, Bishtupur, Jamshedpur, (herein after referred to as ""the Bank""). In the FIR, it has been alleged that a sum of Rs. 5 lakh was sanctioned as loan to these petitioners, who happens to be owners of a shop. Later, the amount of loan was enhanced from Rs. 5 lakhs to Rs. 10 lakhs. By way of security, a sale deed bearing deed no. 5721 dated 27.10.2006 was deposited by the petitioners in the Branch of the bank. The Bank later on obtained a certified copy of the sale deed and it was found that the said [2] sale deed, which was deposited with the Bank, was a forged document. Thus, it was concluded that the petitioners obtained the loan of Rs. 10 lakhs by depositing a forged document. The loan ultimately became bad and an amount of Rs. 9,11,501/- became due, which the petitioners did not pay. On the aforesaid background, the FIR being Bishtupur P.S. Case No. 113 of 2014, was registered. 
 6. The petitioners, thereafter, approached this Court by filing an application underSection 482Cr.P.C. being Cr. M.P. No. 909 of 2014, wherein they challenged the FIR. The said application was withdrawn by the petitioners on 23.04.2015, wherein a liberty was given to these petitioners to raise all the points at an appropriate stage. In the meantime, the investigation proceeded and police ultimately filed a charge sheet against these petitioners. 
 7. On the facts narrated in the charge sheet, and on finding a prima facie case, the Court took cognizance of the offence punishable underSections 406,409,420,467,468,471of the Indian Penal Code, vide order dated 15.06.2015. Notice was issued to these petitioners, but it is the case of the petitioners that they had not received any notice as such they could not appear before the court. It is further case of the petitioners that since they could not appear before the Court, coercive steps were taken against them and ultimately vide order dated 27.04.2018 process underSection 82Cr.P.C. was issued. It has been mentioned that prior to issuance of process underSections 82Cr.P.C., bailable and non-bailable warrant of arrest was also issued. 
 8. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, in support of their contention submits that no criminal offence is made out in the instant case. He submits that this is a case of non-payment of loan, which the petitioners had taken from the Bank and for not repaying the loan amount, a criminal case cannot be instituted. He submits that the Central Bank of India had also filed a certificate case bearing No. 50/BL/2014- 2015, before the Certificate Officer at Jamshedpur, claiming recovery of the loan amount. It is the case of the petitioners that they appeared in the said certificate proceeding and they offered to return the amount and ultimately, they settled the dispute with the Bank and an amount of Rs. 2, 66,000/- was paid to the Bank by way of full and final settlement. It is the case of the petitioner that it was their understanding that both, i.e. the certificate case and the instant criminal case would be withdrawn on the basis of the compromise. He submits that since the Bank has taken the money as per the settlement, the criminal case cannot be allowed to [3] continue and the petitioners cannot be subjected to harassment and be forced to face the rigor of the criminal trial. The petitioner also states that the loan account has been closed by the Bank as the Bank has received the entire money as full and final settlement. He submits that once the Bank has settled the dispute, which is primary, civil in nature, this criminal case cannot be allowed to continue, thus according to him the order taking cognizance is bad. 
 9. Counsel for the petitioner further submits that the order issuing process underSection 82Cr.P.C. is absolutely bad, which does not reflect subjective satisfaction of the court. He submits that it is a mandate that the Court should record subjective satisfaction before issuing process underSection 82Cr.P.C. He submits that in absence of recording of such subjective satisfaction to the effect that the petitioners are evading their arrest or are absconding and it is not possible to execute the warrant, issuance of process underSection 82Cr.P.C. is bad. He lastly submits that since the matter has been compromised in one time settlement, in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court passed in the case of ""Central Bureau of Investigation- versus- Sadhu Ram Singla and Others reported in (2017) 5 SCC 350"", the entire criminal proceeding is liable to be quashed. He submits that this offence cannot be said to be heinous in nature so there is no impediment to quash the entire proceedings. 
 10. To counter the submission of the petitioner, counsel appearing on behalf of the Bank submits that what has been settled is the civil dispute. He submits that there was no settlement nor any assurance was ever given to withdraw the criminal case. He submits that the compromise was solely in respect of non-payment of the loan amount and thus the certificate case was compromised on the basis of one-time settlement. He submits that there is an allegation that the loan was taken on the basis of a forged document, i.e. the sale deed and when there is an allegation of forgery, a criminal case cannot be allowed to be withdrawn or quashed as the offences are non-compoundable. By referring to Annexure- B, counsel for the Bank submits that a decision, of a Committee of the Bank, was taken wherein the Committee observed that the case, which has been filed with the Enforcement Agency, will continue even after approval of the present settlement (OTS) proposal. He submits that this clearly suggests that the criminal case which was pending before the Court will continue and the same was not compounded by the Bank. He relied upon a judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of ""Gopakumar B Nair-versus- Central Bureau of Investigation & Anr, reported in [4] (2014) 5 SCC 800"". He submits that a case which attracts forgery, cannot be withdrawn as the Bank has got no authority to compound cases of forgery. 
 11. I have heard the counsel for the parties and have gone through the entire petition and the pleadings. The major facts are admitted in this case. The petitioners had obtained loan from the Bank and defaulted in repaying the same. The loan was obtained by producing a sale deed as a security. The Bank later on found that the sale deed, which was produced and kept with them, by way of security, was allegedly a forged document. It is an admitted case of the Bank that the dues were settled with the Bank by virtue of a scheme, i.e. One Time Settlement Scheme and the Bank had issued 'No Dues Certificate'. The account, i.e. the loan account of the petitioners was closed by the Bank as settlement had already taken place. 
 10. Now, the question, which falls for consideration before this Court is whether a criminal case can be compounded/quashed on the basis of the settlement arrived at, which is for recovery of a loan account. 
 12. A business or a commercial transaction may have different aspect. A transaction may be pure civil in nature without any criminal aspect or it may be a transaction which is prima-facie civil in nature alongwith some criminal aspect involved. In this case, we have to see as to whether the transaction which has been entered with the Bank by the petitioner was purely civil in nature without any element of criminality or there was a criminal aspect to it. 
 13. Two main facts, which are necessary to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the transaction was purely civil in nature or had any criminal intent, are as follows:- 
 (i) The petitioners took a loan from the bank but, thereafter, failed to repay the same. 
 (ii) The loan was obtained by depositing a sale deed which is alleged to be forged. 
 14. The part of the transaction, i.e. taking of loan and thereafter, failing to repay the same, without any criminal intention can purely be civil in nature, for which there is a civil remedy. 
 15. The second part of the allegation, i.e. that the loan was obtained by depositing a forged document, cannot be said to a pure civil transaction, without any criminal intent. The allegation that the document deposited with the bank is forged, attracts an offence underthe Penal Code. Forgery is an offence underthe Indian Penal Code. The allegation is that a forged deed was produced in the bank and the loan was obtained. This allegation prima-facie attractsSections 467&468of [5]the Indian Penal Code. Thus, the allegation definitely makes out criminal offence, which needs to be tried. 
 16. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of ""Indian Oil Corporation - versus- NEPC India Limited and Others, reported in (2006) 6 SCC 736"" has held that if allegation in the complaint, taken at their face value, disclosed a criminal offence, the complaint cannot be quashed merely because it relates to a commercial transaction or breach of contract for which civil remedy is available or has been availed. 
 17. In view of the aforesaid judgment, we have to see as to whether the instant case is purely civil in nature or has a criminal aspect. As discussed earlier, I find that there is an allegation of forging a deed and thereafter, producing the same in the bank. The loan was obtained on the basis of the said forged deed. This allegation of forgery definitely makes out a criminal offence. The bank may have compromised their dispute so far as the civil liability is concerned, but so far as criminal aspect, the same has not been compromised, rather it could not have been so, as the same is not compoundable. Further, when I see the entire documents and the counter affidavit also and the annexure appended thereto, I find that Annexure-B is a decision of the Committee, which took a decision and observed that the dues would be compounded in terms of the 'OTS' Scheme, but even after accepting the said amount, the criminal case, which is pending, will continue. This clearly suggests that the bank did not compromise the part of the dispute which is criminal in nature. 
 18. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of ""Sushil Suri- versus- Central Bureau of Investigation and Another, reported in (2011) 5 SCC 708"" has held that the loan obtained on forged documents and the person who obtains the loan on a forged documents, needs to be punished as per criminal law and the FIR cannot be quashed. The Hon'ble Supreme Court went on to hold that the defense of the accused that they have fully repaid the loan to the concerned bank and no loss was caused to the bank, cannot be a ground to quash the FIR. 
 19. When a fraud is played with a bank and a loan is obtained by playing fraud, it is not the bank only, which is an aggrieved and suffers a loss. It is the society and the investors at a large who is aggrieved. The money of the depositors and the investors is given as loan to the loanee. If a fraud is committed and the loan amount is not repaid and is swindled it is ultimately the money of the investors and the depositors, which is misappropriated. The bank is a mere custodian of the money of the depositors and the investors. Thus, the ultimate aggrieved person is the [6] depositors, who deposit their money in the bank having faith on the bank. The depositors and the investors lose their faith upon the bank if these types of fraud take place. Another aspect cannot be lost sight of is the possibility of connivance of the bank officials in the transactions. 
 20. In the instant case, I find that the loan was to the tune of Rs. 10 lakhs and alongwith the interest on the principal the amount fell dues is Rs. 9,11,501/-. This amount, which was due, was settled in terms of One Time Settlement Scheme and a paltry sum of Rs. 2,66,000/- only was paid as a full and final settlement. If the contention of the petitioner is accepted that since the one-time settlement was accepted, the criminal case has also to be dropped, then it will have a very bad impact on the banking system and on the financial sectors. This will set a very bad precedent. Then in future every person and unscrupulous businessmen will obtain loan by playing fraud and by submitting fake documents will take huge amount from the bank as a loan and will ultimately settle their dispute by paying a nominal amount, say 10% or 15% of the amount and will be scot- free. This will not only damage and dent the faith of the depositors and the investors upon bank, but will also crumbled the entire edifice of the banking sector and the economy of the country. Further where there is involvement of public money, the banking institutions must be very cautious. Thus, settlement of dues under one-time settlement scheme cannot and should not be a ground to quash the criminal proceeding if there are elements, which attractthe Indian Penal Codeor the other penal laws. More over where by committing forgery a loan has been obtained from a bank, and there after the loanee fails to liquidate the outstanding loan amount, settlement thereafter on payment of a paltry amount, i.e. 30% to 35 % of the entire outstanding amount, is nothing but giving a premium to the offenders. 
 21. The Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Central Bureau of Investigation- versus- Sadhu Ram Singla and Others (supra), whereas the opposite party relies upon the judgment of ""Gopakumar B Nair"" (supra). I have gone through both the judgments. In the judgment reported in Central Bureau of Investigation- versus- Sadhu Ram Singla and Others (supra)"", the Hon'ble Supreme Court quashed the criminal proceeding on the ground that the civil proceeding was compromised and nothing remains to be decided in the criminal case as there would be no evidence. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of ""Gopakumar B Nair"" (supra), refused to quash the criminal proceeding in spite of the fact that the civil proceeding was compromised. 
 [7] The judgment reported in ""Gopakumar B Nair-versus- Central Bureau of Investigation & Anr, (2014) 5 SCC 800' is a Three Judges' Bench judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, whereas the earlier judgment is of Two Judges Bench judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. 
 22. In view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of ""Subhash Chandra & Anr- versus- Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board & Others"" reported in (2009) 15 SCC 458, para-96"", a Three Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court will get precedence over a two Judges Bench judgment. Further, the fact of the case reported in ""Gopakumar B Nair"" (supra) is more or less the same to that of this case. In the aforesaid case, which was dealt with by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, there was no compromise in respect of the criminal aspect of the transaction. In this case also, in view of Annexure-B to the counter affidavit, I find that there was no compromise so far as the criminality is concerned. Thus, on this aspect of fact, this instant case is similar to that of the judgment of ""Gopakumar B Nair"" (supra). 
 23. Thus, on the facts of this case and also in view of the law, as discussed above, the judgment in ""Gopakumar B Nair"" (supra), will fit in the facts of this case. 
 24. Considering what has been held above, I find that one-time settlement which has been arrived at between the bank and the petitioners cannot be a ground to quash the entire criminal proceeding. Since, prima- facie an offence underSections 467,468&471of the Indian Penal Code is made out, the cognizance order cannot be quashed. 
 25. So far as the order dated 27.04.2018, by which process underSection 82Cr.P.C. has been issued, is concerned, I find that the order dated 27.04.2018, issuing process underSection 82Cr.P.C. is absolutely cryptic. No reason has been assigned as to why it is necessary to issue process underSection 82Cr.P.C. The mandatory requirement, i.e. noting down and giving a finding that the petitioners are evading warrant of arrest and are not appearing in the court, is missing. The subjective satisfaction, which the court was duty bound to mention in the order, is missing. Thus, I find that the aforesaid order is cryptic and is not sustainable in the eyes of law. Thus, I am inclined to quash the order dated 27.04.2018, by which process underSection 82Cr.P.C. has been issued against the petitioners. 
 26. Thus, in this application I am only interfering with the order dated 27.04.2018, by which process underSection 82Cr.P.C. has been issued against the petitioners. So far as prayer in relation to quash the [8] order taking cognizance and the entire criminal proceeding is concerned, the same is rejected. The proceeding will continue in view of the observations and findings made above. 
 27. This criminal miscellaneous petition stands disposed of in terms of the observation made above.

 CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJESH SHANKAR For the Petitioner :- Mr. Rohit Roy, Advocate For the State :- Mr. Pravin Akhouri, S.C. (Mines)-I Order No. 07 Dated: 08.09.2020 The present case is taken up through video conferencing. 
 2. The present writ petition has been filed for quashing/setting aside memo no. 534 dated 31.10.2017 (Annexure-6 to the writ petition) issued by the District Panchayat Raj Officer, Hazaribagh (respondent no. 4) by reasons of which an order for recovery of Rs.3,77,016/- has been passed against the petitioner with a direction to deposit the same in the office of Block Development Officer, Katkamdag, failing which an F.I.R. would be lodged against her and the said amount would be recovered through certificate proceeding. Further prayer has been made for restraining the respondents from taking any step for ceasing the financial powers of the petitioner as Mukhiya of Adra Gram Panchayat, Block- Katkamdag, Hazaribag. 
 3. The factual background of the case as stated in the writ petition is that the petitioner is the Mukhiya of Adra Gram Panchayat since December 2010. In the year 2014, the Gram Sabha passed a resolution for purchase of solar street lights as the grants for the same was available under the 13th Finance Commission. The said resolution was also approved by the Panchayat Cabinet comprising the Ward Members, Panchayat Secretary (the government's representative) and the Mukhiya as its Chairman. Accordingly, quotations were invited from three dealers and thereafter on comparison, the supply orders for purchase of 17 solar street lights were placed to the dealer who2quoted the lowest price. Again as per the available funds under the 14th Finance Commission, the Gram Sabha passed resolution for purchase of seven (07) solar street lights which was also approved by the Panchayat Cabinet and as per the procedure, the quotations were invited from three dealers. On comparison of the said quotations, the supply order for seven solar street lights was placed to the dealer quoting the lowest price i.e. M/s. Surya Energy, Hazaribagh. Subsequently, a complaint was made in the Chief Minister's Public Grievance Cell relating to purchase of the solar street lights under the 14th Finance Commission alleging inter alia that the solar light sets were available @ Rs.17,000/- per unit with the Jharkhand Renewable Energy Development Agency (JREDA), but instead of purchasing the same from JREDA, those were purchased at the higher rate from private dealer. The Block Development Officer, Katkamdag (the respondent no. 5) got the matter enquired through Panchayat Sewak who submitted the report vide letter no. 276 dated 01.04.2017 stating inter alia that the purchase of 7 set of solar street lights was made after comparing respective quotations obtained from three dealers out of which M/s Surya Agency was selected having quoted the lowest rate i.e. Rs.31,900/- each. The respondent no. 5, vide memo no. 789 dated 04.09.2017 issued a show cause notice to the petitioner as well as to the Panchayat Secretary, Adra Gram Panchayat seeking clarification regarding the circumstances under which supply orders were placed to M/s. Surya Energy instead of placing the order to the JREDA and as to why resolution no. 221/finance dated 03.02.2011 was not followed in the matter of procurement of the solar street lights. The petitioner submitted reply to the said show cause notice through the Panchayat Secretary, however the said reply was not forwarded by the said Panchayat Secretary to the respondent no. 5. Thereafter, the respondent no. 5 vide letter no. 952 dated 30.10.2017 submitted his enquiry report to the Director, Accounts Administration and Self- Employment, District Rural Development Authority, Hazaribag, a copy of which was also forwarded to the respondent no. 4. Subsequently, an order for recovery of Rs.3,77,016/- as contained in impugned memo no. 534 dated 31.10.2017 was passed with a direction to the petitioner3that if she failed to deposit the said amount, an F.I.R. would be lodged against her and the said amount would be recovered through certificate proceeding. As soon as the petitioner came to know that her reply was not submitted before the respondent no. 5, she requested the respondent no. 5 vide her letter dated 08.11.2017 to recall the order of recovery, however the said request was not considered by the respondent no.5. Thereafter, the petitioner filed representation before the Deputy Commissioner, Hazaribagh (respondent no. 2) on 11.12.2017, however the said representation was also not considered and in the meantime, the petitioner came to know from the news reports that her finanacial power as Mukhiya of the said Panchayat had been ceased. Hence, the present writ petition. 
 4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that JREDA vide letter dated 21.07.2017 had informed the Secretary, Department of Panchayat Raj, Government of Jhakhand that it had no agency empanelled for supply of solar street lights, rather it used to invite e- procurement notice for supply of said articles as and when the need arose. The document related to technical specifications for solar photovoltaic lighting system and power packs was also enclosed with the said letter which would disclose that it was in relation to solar street light set of 40Wp outputs whereas those installed in the Gram Panchayat, Adra were of 74Wp power outputs. It is further submitted that Ministry of New & Renewable Energy, Government of India fixes the rates for solar street lighting system with reference to their output and vide letter dated 30.05.2013, the rate of solar street lighting system was fixed at Rs.450/- per Watt peak (Wp) which was subsequently revised to Rs.475 per Watt peak (Wp) vide letter dated 17.03.2017. The learned counsel for the petitioner thus submits that if the rate of Ministry of New & Renewable Energy, Government of India is taken into consideration, the procurement made by the Gram Panchayat, Adra is well within the prescribed limit. Moreover, the Block Development Officer-cum- Secretary, Panchayat Samiti, Giridih vide memo no. 896 dated 20.03.2015 placed the order for solar street light sets to a private firm @ Rs.31,920/- each. In Simdega district also, the National Small Industries Corporation Limited vide its letter dated401.10.2015 had quoted Rs.34,125/- for solar lighting system of 80Wp. Thus on the basis of the said examples of procurement in other districts, it would be evident that the procurement of solar street lights made by the petitioner was fair, just and transparent. The respondent authorities have not taken any initiative or have apprised the petitioner being the Mukhiya of the said Panchayat and other functionaries about the resolution no. 221 dated 03.02.2011 issued by the Department of Finance, Government of Jharkhand. Even if there has been some violation of the said resolution, the same cannot be said to be intentional as the procedure adopted for procurement of the concerned solar light system was quite transparent and no foul play was involved in the same. The petitioner has however been penalized without providing due opportunity of hearing to her and thus there is a gross violation of the principles of natural justice. Aggrieved with the impugned action taken against the petitioner, the District Mukhiya Association, Hazaribag also represented the Commissioner, North Chotanagpur Division, Hazaribagh on 18.12.2017, however no action was taken by the said authority in this regard. 
 5. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent-State submits that the petitioner procured the solar street lights without following the procedure specified by the Department of Finance, Government of Jharkhand which was mandatory for making public procurement. The petitioner paid much higher rate than the rate prescribed by the JREDA for the said purchase. It is further submitted that a tender should have been invited by the concerned Gram Panchayat for procurement of any article valued more than Rs.1,50,000/- in view of resolution dated 03.02.2011 issued by the Department of Finance, Government of Jharkhand, however the petitioner being the Mukhiya of the said Panchayat purchased the solar street lights having value of more than Rs.1,50,000/- merely on the basis of quotations. There is a well established guideline issued by the state government regarding the purchases to be made by the Panchayats, which has been violated by the petitioner. In fact, the petitioner purchased the solar street lights from the local market @ Rs.31,900/- per unit in place of price fixed by JREDA as Rs.16,191/- per unit. The petitioner altogether5purchased 24 units of solar street lights @ Rs. 31,900/- per unit i.e. worth Rs.7,65,600/- thereby causing loss of Rs.3,77,016/- to the State exchequer. It is also submitted that the respondent no. 5 issued show cause notice to the petitioner and the Panchayat Secretary vide memo no. 789 dated 04.09.2017 with respect to the aforesaid financial irregularity committed by the concerned Panchayat. The petitioner's reply was received by the respondent no. 5 on 08.11.2017 i.e. after two months and till that time, the impugned order was already passed and as such there was no question of consideration of the same. The learned counsel for the respondent-State further submits that the financial power of the petitioner was not ceased till filing of the counter affidavit. The petitioner was required to submit her reply directly to the respondent no. 5 and by not doing so, it can only be said to be a lapse on the part of the petitioner. It is also submitted that Panchayat Raj Office is functional in each and every district of the State to provide relevant information and guideline to the Panchayats in case of any confusion and as such, the petitioner should have approached the said office for seeking instructions before making purchase of solar street lights at higher rate. However by not doing so, Adra Gram Panchayat headed by the petitioner, has committed financial irregularity in purchasing 24 solar street lights and thus put the public exchequer to loss. 
 6. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the materials available on record. The petitioner has challenged the impugned order as contained in memo no. 534 dated 31.10.2017 issued by the respondent no. 4 wherein it has been alleged that the petitioner made purchase of solar street lights by using the funds available under 13th and 14th Finance Commission from a private dealer in violation of the government resolution/circular due to which the public exchequer was put to loss. 
 7. Learned counsel for the respondent-State has put reliance on resolution no. 221 dated 03.02.2011 issued by the Department of Finance, Government of Jharkhand and has submitted that in view of the said resolution, if the purchase was to be made having value of more than 1,50,000/-, the petitioner was required to invite tender by6way of making publication in daily newspaper. However, the said resolution was not followed by her. The applicability of the said resolution has not been put in question by the learned counsel for the petitioner, however it has been submitted that the said violation is not intentional as she was not made aware of the said resolution by the state authorities. 
 8. In the case of Nagar Nigam Vs. Al Faheem Meat Exports (P) Ltd. reported in (2006) 13 SCC 382, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under: 
 ""The law is well settled that contract by the State, its corporations, instrumentalities and agencies must be normally granted through public auction/public tender by inviting tenders from eligible persons and the notification of the public auction or inviting tenders should be advertised in well-known dailies having wide circulation in the locality with all relevant details such as date, time and place of auction, subject-matter of auction, technical specifications, estimated cost, earnest money deposit, etc. The award of government contracts through public auction/public tender is to ensure transparency in the public procurement, to maximise economy and efficiency in government procurement, to promote healthy competition among the tenderers, to provide for fair and equitable treatment of all tenderers, and to eliminate irregularities, interference and corrupt practices by the authorities concerned. This is required byArticle 14of the Constitution. However, in rare and exceptional cases, for instance during natural calamities and emergencies declared by the Government; where the procurement is possible from a single source only; where the supplier or contractor has exclusive rights in respect of the goods or services and no reasonable alternative or substitute exists; where the auction was held on several dates but there were no bidders or the bids offered were too low, etc., this normal rule may be departed from and such contracts may be awarded through ""private negotiations"". (seeRam and Shyam Co. v. State of Haryana[(1985) 3 SCC 267: AIR 1985 SC 1147].) . 
 18. The law is, thus, clear that ordinarily all contracts by the Government or by an instrumentality of the State should be granted only by public auction or by inviting tenders, after advertising the same in well-known newspapers having wide circulation, so that all eligible persons will have an opportunity to bid in the bid (sic auction), and there is total transparency. In our opinion this is an essential requirement in a democracy, where the people are supreme, and all official acts must be actuated by the public interest, and should inspire public confidence."" 
 9. It is thus well settled that ordinarily the State instrumentalities should not give contracts on the basis of private negotiations, rather the same should be done by way of open public auction/tender on7wide publicity. The purpose behind this is to maintain transparency in public purchase on competitive rate. 
 10. Coming back to the present writ petition, learned counsel for the petitioner has tried to convince the Court that violation of the resolution dated 03.02.2011 issued by the Department of Finance, Government of Jharkhand was not intentional, rather the same was due to ignorance of the petitioner as she was never made aware of the said resolution. I do not find any substance in the said contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner. Since the petitioner being the Mukhiya was holding a statutory post, it was expected from her that she would know the manner/procedure in which public purchase was to be made while exercising the financial powers. Moreover, the stand of the respondent-State is that the petitioner by making purchase of 24 solar street lights from a private dealer on higher rate than prescribed put the state exchequer to loss. 
 11. Further argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that the respondent no. 4 has violated the principles of natural justice while passing the impugned order as the reply submitted by the petitioner in pursuance of issuance of show cause notice was not considered. To appreciate the said argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner, I have gone through the record of the case and on perusal of the same, it is evident that the show cause notice contained in memo no. 789 dated 04.09.2017 was duly served to the petitioner which was not directly submitted by her to the concerned Block Development Officer (the respondent no. 5), rather according to her, she submitted it through the Panchayat Secretary who allegedly did not forward the same to the respondent no. 5 in time due to which her reply was not considered. The petitioner has however failed to explain any justifiable reason as to why the reply was not directly sent to the respondent no. 5. Thus, I am of the considered view that the petitioner by not choosing to file her reply directly to the respondent no. 5 cannot allege violation of principles of natural justice for her own wrong. I find justification in the contention of the learned counsel for the respondent-State that since the impugned order was already passed by the respondent no. 4, the reply having been received8subsequently i.e. on 08.11.2017, could not have been considered. Accordingly, I do not find any infirmity in the decision making process of the respondent authorities. 
 12. One of the contentions of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that the procurement of solar street lights has been made at a reasonable rate by inviting quotation from three different dealers. On the contrary, the contention of the learned counsel for the State respondent is that the petitioner made purchase of solar street lights @ Rs.31,900/- per unit i.e. much higher than the rate fixed by JREDA i.e. @ Rs.16,191/- per unit and thereby the petitioner caused revenue loss to the State exchequer. In my view, the matter regarding public purchase is to be considered strictly by the Court. The petitioner by giving examples of purchase of solar street lights in different districts on the higher rates cannot justify the purchase of concerned solar street lights @ Rs.31,900/- particularly when she admittedly did not follow the resolution dated 03.02.2011 issued by the Department of Finance, Government of Jharkhand. 
 13. Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstance, I find no ground to interfere with the impugned order as contained in memo no. 534 dated 31.10.2017 passed by the respondent no. 4. So far as the prayer of the petitioner with regard to restraining the respondents from taking steps for ceasing her financial power is concerned, there is no need to pass any order on the same in view of the stand of the respondents taken in the counter affidavit that till filling of the same, no such action was taken against the petitioner. 
 14. The writ petition being devoid of merit is accordingly dismissed.

 2. This case was listed/supposed to be listed, before the Lawazima Board of the Registrar General for praying an order in respect of the defects, pointed out by the office. 
 3. Considering the pandemic situation where the Court has minimized the footfall of the lawyers and their clerks in the Court, this Court felt it proper to get all the cases listed before this Court so that the defects can be looked into at this stage only. Thus, this case is listed today before this Court directly. 
 4. There are several defects and one of the defects is in respect of the deficit court fee. 
 5. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner undertakes to deposit the deficit court fee within two weeks from today. Rest of the defects stand ignored for the present. 
 6. With the consent of the parties, the matter is taken up for hearing on merits. 
 7. In this criminal miscellaneous petition, the petitioner has prayed for quashing the order dated 19.02.2020 passed by the learned Additional District Judge VI, Dhanbad in C.P. Case No.2237 of 2016, whereby processes underSection 82of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been issued against the petitioner. 
 8. While I go through the order dated 19.02.2020, I find that the said order is merely an order correcting the order dated 09.01.2020. By virtue of order dated 09.01.2020, the Court below had issued attachment order under 
 -: 2 : - 
 Section 83Cr.P.C., but, vide the order dated 19.02.2020, the Court below corrected his mistake and held that inadvertently attachment order underSection 83Cr.P.C. was issued in place of processes underSection 82Cr.P.C., hence, it is rectified to the extent that in place of processes underSection 83Cr.P.C., processes underSection 82Cr.P.C. be read and issued afresh against the accused. In sum and substance, the petitioner was aggrieved by order dated 09.01.2020 read with 19.02.2020, by which processes underSection 82Cr.P.C. has been issued. 
 9. This case has a history. This is a second round of litigation on the same issue. On 05.12.2018, the Special Judge-cum-1st Additional District Judge, Dhanbad in S.T. S.C. Case No.232 of 2018 issued processes underSection 82Cr.P.C. against the petitioner, who is the sole accused. It is necessary to quote the said order dated 05.12.2018, which reads as under: - 
 ""05.12.18 Complainant filed attendance through lawyer. Accused is absent. E/R of N.B.W. issued against him is received according to which the accused is running away due to fear of arrest. Office to process 82Cr.P.C. against him. Put up on 16.01.19 for appearance."" 
 10. The said order was challenged before this Court in an application underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure being Cr. M.P. No.650 of 2019. An Hon'ble Bench of this Court allowed the said criminal miscellaneous petition by setting aside the order dated 05.12.2018 on the ground that the Court below has not assigned any reasons or recorded its satisfaction that the accused was absconding or concealing himself. It was further held that the order has been passed in a mechanical manner without application of judicial mind. Thus, the order dated 05.12.2018 was quashed and set aside and the matter was remanded to the Special Judge to pass a reasoned and speaking order in accordance with law. It is necessary to quote para 2 of the order dated 03.07.2019 passed by the Bench of this Court in Cr. M.P. No.650 of 2019, which reads as under: - 
 04/03.07.2019 
 1. ........ 
 2. Having heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned A.P.P. it transpires that the court below has ordered for issuance of processes underSection 82Cr.P.C. on receipt of the execution report of NBW. The court below, while passing the order has not assigned any reasons or recorded its satisfaction that the-: 3 :-accused was absconding or concealing himself. That the order has been passed in a mechanical manner without application of judicial mind. Accordingly, the order dated 05.12.2018 is, hereby, quashed and set aside. The court below shall pass reasoned and speaking order, in accordance with law."" 
 11. The aforesaid order was received by the Court below on 09.07.2019. On 19.07.2019, the learned Special Judge, after going through the order passed by this Court in Cr. M.P. No.650 of 2019 and referring to the same, issued fresh non-bailable warrant of arrest against the accused. The concerned Special Judge awaited for execution report of the warrant of arrest, which is apparent from the orders dated 26.08.2019 and 01.10.2019. On 14.11.2019, as per the office order of the Principal District & Sessions Judge, Dhanbad, the case was transferred to the Court of Special Judge, SC ST, Dhanbad. The concerned Special Judge, then, on the next date fixed, i.e., on 02.12.2019 awaited for the service report and fixed the case on 09.01.2020. On 09.01.2020, the following order was passed: - 
 09/1/20 Complaint filed attendance through lawyer. Accused is still absent. O/c to issue 83 against the accused persons. 
 Put up on 28/1/20 for appearance. 
 12. On the next date, i.e., 28.01.2020, the Court records that the execution report of 83Cr.P.C. is awaited thus fixed the case on 19.02.2020. On 19.02.2020, when the record was put up, the concerned Special Judge perused the record and found that the Hon'ble Court on 03.07.2019 had set aside the order of Special Judge by which processes underSection 82Cr.P.C. was issued. He also records that thereafter fresh non-bailable warrant of arrest was issued, but, it transpired that inadvertently processes underSection 83Cr.P.C. was issued, which the Court then rectified and issued processes underSection 82Cr.P.C. in place of processes underSection 83Cr.P.C. This means, the Court only corrected the order dated 09.01.2020 by which processes underSection 83Cr.P.C. was issued in place of processes underSection 82Cr.P.C. The practical impact of the order is that in order dated 09.01.2020, in place of processes underSection 83Cr.P.C., processes underSection 82Cr.P.C. is to be read. Thus, from the aforesaid fact, it is clear that the substantive order by which processes underSection 82Cr.P.C. was issued after the matter was remanded to the Court concerned by the High Court, is dated 09.01.2020. 
 -: 4 : - 
 13. The order dated 09.01.2020 has already been quoted above and it speaks for itself. The approach and the manner in which the orders, i.e., order dated 09.01.2020 and the order dated 19.02.2020 have been passed by the Special Judge is highly deprecated by this Court. The Special Judge has failed to understand the content and intent of the order dated 03.07.2019 passed by the High Court in Cr. M.P. No.650 of 2019. The said order passed by the High Court has also been quoted above. There was a specific direction by the High Court to pass a reasoned and speaking order, as the earlier order passed underSection 82Cr.P.C. ""has not assigned any reasons or recorded its satisfaction that the accused was absconding or concealing himself."" This was a specific direction given by the High Court. The Special Judge in the orders dated 09.01.2020 and 19.02.2020, has ignored the aforesaid direction of the High Court and again passed a most mechanical order. The aforesaid orders passed by the Special Judge are more mechanical than the earlier order dated 05.12.2018, which has been set aside by the High Court. This is nothing, but, an utmost judicial indiscipline. The order dated 19.02.2020 clearly suggests that the Court had gone through the order dated 03.07.2019 passed by the High Court. This Court cannot fathom that the order dated 03.07.2019 of the High Court, which is written in a most simple language, is not understood by the Special Judge, who is a Judicial Officer in the rank of District Judge. When the High Court directs any subordinate Court to pass a reasoned and speaking order, the Subordinate Court is duty bound to pass a reasoned order. He cannot ignore or bypass the directions given by the High Court. This act of Special Judge, Dhanbad in not adhering to the directions of the High Court is highly deprecated. The approach of the Special Judge is too casual in this case. The Special Judge, Dhanbad is cautioned to be cautious in future while drawing up ordersheets, especially the ordersheets which are drawn up pursuant to the directions given by the High Court. 
 14. Now, on the merits of the case, the order dated 19.02.2020 by which processes underSection 82Cr.P.C. has been issued, as has been mentioned above, is a corrective order. The substantive order is dated 09.01.2020. As held earlier, this order is more cryptic and mechanical, than the earlier order, which has been set aside by this Court in Cr. M.P. No.650 of 2019.

 This case was listed/ supposed to be listed before the Lawazima Board of the Registrar General for passing an order in respect of the defects, pointed out by the office. 
 Considering the pandemic situation where the Court has minimized the footfall of the lawyers and their Clerks in the Court, this court felt proper to get all the cases listed before this Court so that the defects can be looked into at this stage only. Thus, this case is listed today before this Court directly. 
 The defects stand ignored for the present. 
 With the consent of the parties, the matter is taken up for hearing on merits. 
 Heard the parties. 
 The petitioner is challenging the order dated 04.06.2018, passed in G.R. 1841 of 2016, by which the petitioner has been summoned after taking cognizance of the offence punishable underSections 341,323,504,506,386,379/34of the Indian Penal Code. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that in a most mechanical manner the cognizance has been taken. He submits that there are no materials against this petitioner. He submits that with an express authority the Company of this petitioner has seized the vehicle, which was on hire purchase. He submits that intimation about seizure and also about pre-seizure was given to the police station, in spite of that with a malafide intention this FIR has been lodged. He further submits that as the installments of hire purchase was not paid, the vehicle was seized and handed over to the financer. He further refers to the order passed by this Court in the case of ""Amresh Kumar Dhiraj & Ors.- versus- State of Jharkhand & Anr, reported in 2020 (1) JLJR 199"" and submits that the order taking cognizance and issuing summon is absolutely cryptic and non-speaking, thus, needs to be quashed. 
 After going through the record, I find that the order dated 04.06.2018 is absolutely cryptic and non-speaking one and is not in conformity with the judgment passed by this Court in the case, referred to above. What are the materials against the petitioner to proceed, or what is the overtact of the petitioner has also not been mentioned. Thus, the impugned order dated 04.06.2018, passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Garhwa in G.R. No. 1841 of 2016, is, hereby, set aside. The matter is remitted to the Court below to pass a fresh order in accordance with the provisions of law.

 Learned counsel for the State has further submitted that learned court below has also considered this aspect while passing the impugned order stating therein at the second last para of impugned order that petitioner was granted bail in another case, so the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner is not well founded, as such, both the cases have not amalgamated together, otherwise the court below have amalgamated both the cases together.

 The appellant has been convicted and sentenced for the offence underSection 306of the Indian Penal Code on the allegation that due to the atrocities committed by him, his wife had committed suicide alongwith two children.

No. 282 of 2017. 
 The Trial Court below however, before issuing the release order shall satisfy itself that the appellant has remained in custody for more than three years, and if this submission is found to be incorrect, the release order shall not be issued and the matter shall be reported to this Court. 
 The aforesaid interlocutory application stands allowed with the direction as above.

 For the Petitioner : Mr. P.K. Mukhopadhyay, Advocate For the State: A.P.P. 
 For the O.P. No.2 : None 
 ---- 
 5/ 08.09.2020 The lawyers have no objection with regard to the proceeding, which has been held through Video Conferencing today at 11.00 a.m. They have no complain in respect to the audio and video clarity and quality. 
 2. The defects stand ignored for the present. 
 3. With the consent of the parties, the matter is taken up for hearing on merits. 
 4. Petitioner has challenged the order dated 29.05.2019 passed by the Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Dhanbad in C.P. Case No.617 of 2018, whereby cognizance has been taken for the offence underSection 420of the Indian Penal Code and thereafter petitioner has been summoned. 
 5. Counsel for the petitioner submits that since the agreement itself is void, petitioner cannot be proceeded underSection 420of the Indian Penal Code. He submits that the petitioner is a retired police official and he has been falsely implicated in this case. 
 6. I have heard the counsel for the petitioner and the counsel for the State and have gone through the records. 
 7. From the First Information Report, I find that there is an allegation that the petitioner has entered into an agreement with the informant and has taken money to provide job to the informant in a Public Sector Undertaking, i.e., Heavy Engineering Corporation (HEC), Ranchi. On such false insurance of the petitioner, money was given. Thereafter the accused persons did not provide any job. This entire transaction ie. alluring the informant and taking payment of Rs.1,02,800/- on the pretext of providing job in Public Sector is itself an offence. So far as contention of the petitioner that the agreement of providing job itself is void, for which no criminal case can be instituted, cannot-: 2 :-be a ground to quash the criminal proceeding. It is a settled principle of law that a void contract is not enforceable, but there is no prohibition in initiating criminal proceeding against the person, who has allured unemployed person and cheated them on the pretext of providing job. 8 Thus, I find no merit in this criminal miscellaneous petition. This criminal miscellaneous petition is, accordingly, dismissed.

 2. This case was listed/supposed to be listed before the Lawazima Board of the Registrar General for passing an order in respect of the defects, pointed out by the Office. 
 3. Considering the pandemic situation where the Court has minimized the footfall of the lawyers and their Clerks in the Court, this Court felt proper to get all the cases listed before this Court so that the defects can be looked into at this stage only. Thus, this case is listed today before this Court directly. 
 4. The defects stand ignored for the present. 
 5. With the consent of the parties, the matter is taken up for hearing on merits. 
 6. Petitioners have challenged the order dated 11.12.2018 passed by the Sessions Judge-cum-Special Judge, Chatra in Bashistha Nagar Police Station Case No.09 of 2018, by which processes underSection 82of the Code of Criminal Procedure have been issued. They also challenge the order dated 29.03.2019, by which attachment order in terms ofSection 83of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been issued. 
 7. While going through the impugned orders, I find that just because anticipatory bail application of 7 other co-accused persons got dismissed, the Court below had reasons to believe that these petitioners had also got knowledge about this case and they have absconded. This ground mentioned by the Court below is not tenable. The order is absolutely cryptic. There is nothing on record to suggest that police ever went to arrest these petitioners or ever notices were served upon them. Subjective satisfaction, which is-: 2 :-mandatory in terms ofSection 82of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not reflected in the order issuing processes underSection 82of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Thus, the order dated 11.12.2018 passed in Bashistha Nagar Police Station Case No.09 of 2018, by which processes underSection 82of the Code of Criminal Procedure have been issued is hereby set aside. 
 8. So far as the attachment order in terms ofSection 83of the Code of Criminal procedure is concerned, I find that the same is also not in accordance with law. More so, when the order issuing processes underSection 82of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been set aside, the order dated 29.03.2019 issuing attachment order in terms ofSection 83of the Code of Criminal Procedure being a consequential order is also, hereby, set aside. 
 9. The matter is remanded to the Court below to pass fresh orders in accordance with law.

Case No.105 of 2019. 
 2. Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that perusal of FIR reveals that the victim girl is aged 16 years and the petitioner is aged about 17 years. It is submitted that no doubt offence underSection 376IPC is heinous but it appears from the recital in the FIR that the petitioner and the victim were having love affairs. It is argued that at the time of occurrence the petitioner was residing at Daltonganj alongwith his elder brother and pursuing his studies. It is alleged in the FIR that, on life threats given by the petitioner, the victim took a bus and travelled from Garhwa to Daltonganj where the petitioner met her at the Bus stand and took her to his room. He put vermilion on her forehead and established physical relationship which continued for over a month. It is submitted that since the petitioner refused to marry the victim, therefore the instant case was lodged with the intention to pressurize the petitioner to marry her. 
 3. Learned APP has opposed and submitted in the impugned order it is mentioned that the petitioner requires psychological treatment. It is contended that it is mentioned in the impugned order that there is lack of proper care by the parents and keeping him in observation home is essential for betterment of the mental condition of-2-the petitioner. 
 On query by the Court as to how the victim had reached Daltonganj learned APP could not provide any satisfactory answer. 
 4. Heard. It is evident from the FIR that the petitioner and the victim knew each other. The victim had travelled from Garhwa to Daltonganj to meet the petitioner. Physical relationship between the petitioner and the victim continued for more than a month and the FIR was lodged after an inordinate delay. In the attending facts and circumstances, the petitioner is directed to be released on bail on his furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/-(Rupees Ten thousand only) with two sureties of like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Principal Magistrate, Juvenile Justice Board, Garhwa, in connection with Ramkanda P.S.

 Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the cognizance order is absolutely bad and is a non-speaking order and does not reflect any subjective satisfaction as to what are the materials to take cognizance against these petitioners. He submits that the requirement ofSection 204Cr.P.C. has not been dealt with in the impugned order. 
 After going through the record, I find that the order is absolutely cryptic and non-speaking and is not in conformity with the judgment passed by this Court in the case of ""Amresh Kumar Dhiraj & Ors.- versus- State of Jharkhand & Anr, reported in 2020 (1) JLJR 199"". What are the materials against the petitioner to proceed, has also not been mentioned. Thus, the impugned order dated 03.11.2018, passed by the C.J.M. Hazaribagh, in G.R.

 Aforesaid allegation definitely makes out an offence, which needs investigation. Further, from perusal of the FIR, cognizable offence is made out. Whether the allegation is true or false cannot be seen at this stage. Further, whether the informant had filed similar nature of cases against other persons can be appreciated by the court at the time of framing of charge and not at this stage where cognizance has to be taken. Cognizance is taken basing on the allegation leveled in the FIR and the materials which surfaced during investigation. 
 In this case, since there are materials to take cognizance of offence, the court has taken cognizance and summoned this petitioner. I find no illegality in the impugned order. Thus, this application stands dismissed. 
 However, liberty is given to the petitioner to raise all the points, which have been raised in this application at the time of framing charge, which would be considered by the court below without being prejudiced by this order.

 2/08.09.2020 Heard the parties. 
 Defect no. 9 (i) & (ii) as pointed out by the office are ignored. The petitioner is an accused in connection with Dhanbad Mahila P.S. Case No. 8 of 2020. 
 It has been alleged that the petitioner had established physical relationship with the informant on gun point. Suspecting illicit relationship between the informant and the petitioner, the husband of the informant consumed kerosene oil. 
 It appears that an undertaking was given by the petitioner in Mahila P. S. Case No. which has been brought on record and the same reveals that the relationship between the informant and her husband was not cordial. The dispute stems from the conversation made by the informant with another person of the locality as would appear from the undertaking and the same also hints at a relationship with the petitioner. In the statement underSection 164Cr.P.C. of the victim, it has been stated that the petitioner had twice established physical relationship with her. 
 Mr. Suraj Singh, learned counsel for the informant while going through the FIR has stated that physical relationship was forcibly established by the petitioner on the threat of committing the murder of her child and husband. 
 However, as stated above, the undertaking does reveal a hint of relationship between the petitioner and the informant and such fact circumstances does implore this court to grant bail to the petitioner. 
 Regard being had to the above, the petitioner above named is directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each, to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate 1st class, Dhanbad in connection with Dhanbad Mahila P.S. Case No. 8 of 2020.

 The defects stand ignored for the present. 
 Petitioner has challenged the first information report being Jasidih Police Station Case No.468 of 2019, which has been registered underSection 376of the Indian Penal Code. 
 Counsel for the petitioner, by referring to Annexure 3, submits that the petitioner was appearing in an examination at Dhanbad for the post of Constable. He submits that the examination was held on 01.09.2019 from 09.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. in the first sitting and from 03.00 p.m. to 04.00 p.m. in the second sitting. He submits that it is not expected from the petitioner to have committed this offence and the allegation is absolutely improbable. He submits that due to previous enmity between the parties, the instant case has been lodged. 
 I have gone through the first information. The allegations in the first information report suggests that at night on 01.09.2019, this petitioner has committed rape upon the petitioner. The allegation in the first information report, definitely, makes out a cognizable offence, which needs investigation. Whether the petitioner was present at the place of occurrence or not is a matter of investigation. His alibi cannot be looked at the stage of quashing of FIR. I want to only highlight that the time of examination on 01.09.2019 is from 09.30 a.m. till 04.00 p.m. whereas the time of occurrence is at night about 01.00 a.m. Since the entire allegation needs a proper investigation including-: 2 :-the defence of the petitioner, I am not inclined to quash the first information report as an offence is made out. 
 This criminal miscellaneous petition, accordingly, stands dismissed.

 4. The criminal appeal was filed against the judgment of conviction and the order of sentence dated 03.08.2009 passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Dhanbad in connection with Dhanbad P.S. Case No. 399/2002 corresponding to G.R. No. 1974/2002 (T.R.

He submitted that the marriage had taken place as back as on 30.05.1996 and as per the statement of the petitioner recorded underSection 313of Cr.P.C., he was 35 years of age on 09.04.2009 and accordingly, at present the petitioner is aged about 45 years. 
 8. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that the F.I.R. in the present case is of 08.08.2002 and since then, more than 18 years have already elapsed. The learned counsel also submitted that the learned trial court had convicted the petitioner and other family members of the petitioner underSection 498-Aof Indian Penal Code as well as underSection 4of Dowry Prohibition Act, but the learned appellate court acquitted all the accused persons so far as the offence underSection 4of Dowry Prohibition Act is concerned and also acquitted all other co-accused persons, except the petitioner, so3far as the offence underSection 498-Aof I.P.C. is concerned. The learned counsel submitted that ultimately, the petitioner, the husband of the Informant, is the sole person whose conviction and sentence has remained i.e for the offence underSection 498-Aof I.P.C.. The learned counsel also submitted that although he is not arguing on the merits of the case in view of the order admitting the criminal revision petition which confined it only on the point of sentence of the petitioner, but the aspect that the petitioner has been convicted on general allegations may be considered while considering the point of sentence of the petitioner. The learned counsel further submitted that the petitioner is also ready to give some amount by way of fine. He submitted that considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, the sentence imposed upon the petitioner may be modified. 
 9. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Opposite Party- State of Jharkhand, on the other hand, submitted that concurrent findings have been recorded by the learned courts below against the present petitioner so far as the offence underSection 498-Aof I.P.C. is concerned. However, he did not dispute the fact that the marriage was solemnized in the year 1996 and the F.I.R. is of the year 2002 and at present, the petitioner would be around 45 years of age. It has also come in the learned trial court's judgment that the present offence of the petitioner is his first offence. 
 10. The learned counsel for the Opposite Party- State also submitted that if this Court is inclined to modify the sentence, then the fine amount should be enhanced by not less than Rs.10,000/- and the amount may be directed to be paid to the victim of the case. 
 11. After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, this Court finds that the present case has been admitted only on the point of sentence and the First Information Report was4instituted as back as in the year 2002 and since then, more than 18 years have already elapsed and the petitioner has faced the rigours of the criminal case for a long time. This Court further finds from the trial court judgment that the present case against the petitioner is his first offence and the petitioner has faced the rigorous of criminal case for a long time. Admittedly, the petitioner's conviction and sentence undersection 498Aonly was sustained by the learned lower appellate court. 
 12. Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is of the view that the ends of justice would be served, if the sentence of the petitioner for offence underSection 498(A)of I.P.C is modified by reducing the punishment to one-year Rigorous Imprisonment with additional fine of Rs. 20,000/-. The additional fine amount should be deposited by the petitioner before the learned trial court within a period of two months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. The learned trial court is directed to remit the total fine amount of Rs. 25,000/- ( 20,000/- + 5000/- imposed by learned court below) to the informant of the case upon due identification. If the fine amount is not deposited as indicated above, the petitioner would serve the entire sentence imposed by the learned trial court. 
 13. Accordingly, this criminal revision petition is hereby disposed of with the aforesaid modification of the sentence. 
 14. Interim order, if any, stands vacated. 
 15. Bail bonds furnished by the petitioner are cancelled. 
 16. Pending interlocutory application, if any, is dismissed as not pressed. 
 17. Let the Lower Court Records be immediately sent back to the court concerned. 
 18. Let a copy of this Judgment be communicated to the learned court below through ""FAX/e-mail"".

386,37285155,Sobrati Mian vs The State Of Jharkhand,"(Shree Chandrashekhar, J.), (Ratnaker Bhengra, J.)","9 September, 2020",,"['Section 302 in The Indian Penal Code', 'Section 161 in The Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973', 'Section 34 in The Indian Penal Code']",1,"['in ""takdir samsuddin sheikh v. state of gujarat', 'darya singh v. state of punjab', 'vide mahendra pratap singh v. state of u.p']","
 Per, Shree Chandrashekhar,J. Dated: 9th September, 2020 (Oral) The appellant has been convicted and sentenced to RI for life and a fine of Rs. 2,000/- undersection 302IPC for committing murder of Mulwa Devi. 
 2. The case of the prosecution is that Sobrati Mian had illicit relationship with Mulwa Devi. In the evening of 27 th July, 2008, at about 6:30 PM, Sobrati Mian came to house of the informant. At that time, Mulwa Devi was cooking food. A quarrel started between Sobrati Mian and Mulwa Devi and suddenly Sobrati Mian struck a tangi blow on the head of Mulwa Devi. The informant tried to apprehend him but somehow he managed to escape. On the basis of statement of Doman Ram recorded at 8:30 AM on 28th July, 2008 at Sadar Hospital, Hazaribag, Sadar (Muffasil) P.S. Case No. 690 of 2008 was registered against Sobrati Mian and two unknown persons. After the investigation a charge-sheet was submitted against the appellant undersection 302/34IPC and he has faced the trial on the charge of committing murder of Mulwa Devi. 
 3. During the trial, the prosecution has examined altogether ten witnesses out of whom PW-5, PW-6, PW-7 and PW-8 are related to the deceased and the appellant has examined himself as DW-1. 
 4. PW-9, Dr. K.K. Verma who has conducted the post-mortem examination on 28th July, 2008 has found fracture of right parietal bone of the head of Mulwa Devi of the size of ""3 inches x ¼ inch"", brain deep. He has also observed surgical stitches over the said injury and found that fist of both hand of Mulwa Devi were half clinged. In his estimation the time elapsed since death was 4 to 36 hours and the cause of death was shock and haemorrhage due to the head injury. 
 5. Mulwa Devi has suffered a homicidal death has not been challenged by the appellant, however, the case set up by the defence is that the informant who was suffering humiliation due to illicit relationship between the appellant and his wife has killed her and falsely implicated the appellant in this case. 
 6. PW-5 and PW-7 are closely related to Mulwa Devi, the deceased. PW-5 is father of Mulwa Devi and PW-7 is her husband. They are the eye-witnesses in this case and their evidence has been challenged on the ground of their close relationship with the deceased. In ""Waman Vs. State of Maharashtra"" reported in (2011) 7 SCC 295, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed that merely because the witnesses are related to the complainant or the deceased their evidence cannot be thrown out and if their evidence is found to be consistent and true, the fact of being relative cannot by itself discredit their evidence. A word of caution, however, has been indicated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a series of judgements, one being in ""Sawarn Singh Vs. State of Punjab"" reported in ( 1976) 4 SCC 369, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed that the evidence of an interested witness does not suffer from any infirmity as such but the Courts require as a rule of prudence, not as a rule of law, that the evidence of such witnesses should be scrutinized with a little care. 
 7. PW-5 has stated in his examination-in-chief that at about 6:00 PM he was sitting in the house of his daughter. The appellant who was carrying a tangi came there and holding Mulwa Devi by her hair started assaulting her and when his daughter protested he assaulted her on her head with tangi. However, in his cross-examination he has admitted that in the3evening around the time of occurrence he had gone to the shop of Raghuni Yadav for tobacco and when he came back to the house of his daughter he found the informant crying. On such evidence, PW-5 cannot claim to be an eye-witness and, therefore, the case of the prosecution against the appellant would now depend on a solitary witness, PW-7. 
 8.In ""Takdir Samsuddin Sheikh v. State of Gujarat"" reported in (2011) 10 SCC 158, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed that: 
 ""This Court has consistently held that as a general rule the court can and may act on the testimony of a single witness provided he is wholly reliable. There is no legal impediment in convicting a person on the sole testimony of a single witness. That is the logic ofSection 134of the Evidence Act, 1872. But if there are doubts about the testimony, the court will insist on corroboration. In fact, it is not the number, the quantity, but the quality that is material."" 
 9. Since, evidence of PW-7 has been seriously challenged by the defence on the ground of his being an inimical and highly interested witness, we would also examine whether the evidence of PW-7 is corroborated by any other independent evidence. 
 10. The appellant has set up a defence that PW-7, the informant, is an old man whereas Mulwa Devi was quite young. The informant was not able to satisfy her sexual urges and, therefore, she had turned to Sobrati Mian. The illicit relationship between the appellant and Mulwa Devi had caused great embarrassment to the informant and he was ousted from the village and thereafter he came to village Pipcho. PW-5 has admitted in his cross-examination that his daughter was second wife of the informant and at the time of his marriage the informant was aged about forty years and the informant has admitted that he was married to Mulwa Devi about 25-26 years back. He has also admitted that he had submitted pension forms and in his cross-examination the defence has put a suggestion to him that pension is provided after 62 years of age. The informant has stated in his cross-examination that he could not over power the appellant after the occurrence because he is an old person while the appellant is quite young. In his cross-examination, PW-5 has admitted that there was a panchayati in the village in relation to the questionable relationship between the appellant and his daughter. It has also come in the evidence of PW-5 that to the west of house of the informant there are mixture plant and crusher machine of Nageshwar Gope in which about 50-60 people live and the road passing4through the house of the informant is a freeway and there is a hotel. Mr. Anil Kumar Sinha, the learned counsel for the appellant has rightly submitted that it is unbelievable that no one from the vicinity has come forward to depose in the Court that he has seen the occurrence or at least found the appellant running away from house of the informant. 
 11. While examining the evidence of PW-7, we are reminded of observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in ""Darya Singh v. State of Punjab"" reported in AIR 1965 SC 328: ""There can be no doubt that in a murder case when evidence is given by near relatives of the victim and the murder is alleged to have been committed by the enemy of the family, Criminal Courts must examine the evidence of the interested witnesses, like the relatives of the victim very carefully"". 
 12. There are other features of the case which also create a serious doubt on involvement of the appellant in the crime. The informant has admitted in the Court that the fardbeyan which was produced in the Court is not the statement which he gave to the police and the statement which was recorded by the Investigating Officer was not read over to him. According to the prosecution, the fardbeyan of the informant was recorded by Sanjeev Kumar Singh, Sub Inspector of Police at Sadar Hospital, Hazaribag, however, during the trial he was not examined as a witness. PW-1, PW-2, PW-3 and PW-4, the co-villagers, have turned hostile and PW-6 and PW-8 who are also intimately related to the deceased and according to the informant they came to his house immediately after the occurrence have not seen the appellant running away or around house of the informant. The Investigating Officer has deposed in the Court that PW-5 and PW-7, both, said before him about illicit relationship between the appellant and Mulwa Devi. He has further stated that PW-5 in his statement undersection 161CrPC had stated that he had gone for tobacco in the evening of 27th July, 2008 and after about twenty minutes he came back to the house of the informant. 
 13. From cross-examination of PW-5 and PW-7 and evidence of the Investigating Officer, we find that there are serious omissions and improvements in their evidence in the Court. In ""Sunil Kumar Sambhudayal Gupta (Dr.) and others Vs. State of Maharashtra"" reported in (2010) 13 SCC 657, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed as under: 
 ""32. The discrepancies in the evidence of eyewitnesses, if found to be not minor in nature, may be a ground for disbelieving and discrediting their evidence. In such circumstances, witnesses may not inspire confidence and if their evidence is found to be in conflict and contradiction with other evidence or with the statement already recorded, in such a case it cannot be held that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. (Vide Mahendra Pratap Singh v. State of U.P.) 
 33. In case, the complainant in the FIR or the witness in his statement underSection 161CrPC, has not disclosed certain facts but meets the prosecution case first time before the court, such version lacks credence and is liable to be discarded. (Vide State v. Sait.)"" 
 14. On a closure scrutiny of the testimony of PW-7, we are of the opinion that his evidence which suffers from serious contradictions does not inspire confidence of the Court and it would be unsafe to base conviction of the appellant on his testimony. 
 15. Finally, we came to a conclusion that the prosecution has failed to establish the charge undersection 302IPC against the appellant. 
 16. Accordingly, the judgement of conviction undersection 302IPC and the order of sentence of RI for life with fine of Rs.2,000/-, both dated 18.10.2011, passed against the appellant, namely, Sobrati Mian by the learned 2nd Additional Sessions Judge, Hazaribag in Sessions Trial No. 67 of 2009 are set-aside. 
 17. Mrs. Nehala Sharmin, the learned A.P.P. states that the appellant is in custody. 
 18. Accordingly, the appellant, namely, Sobrati Mian shall be set free forthwith, if not wanted in connection to any other criminal case. 
 19. In the result, Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 600 of 2011 is allowed. 
 20. Let lower court records be transmitted to the court concerned, forthwith. 
 21. Let a copy of the judgment be transmitted to the court concerned through 'FAX'.

 ---- 
 8/09.09.2020 Heard Mr. Sabyasanchi, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, Ms. Ruchi Rampuria, the learned AC to SC-II appearing on behalf of the respondent-State and Mrs. Richa Sanchita, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent-Jharkhand Academic Council [JAC]. . 
 2. This writ petition has been heard through Video Conferencing in view of the guidelines of the High Court taking into account the situation arising due to COVID-19 pandemic. None of the parties have complained about any technical snag of audio-video and2with their consent this matter has been heard. 
 3. The petitioner has preferred this writ petition for a direction upon the respondents to reckon cut-off date for upper age limit in view of Advertisement No.27 of 2011 is on 01.07.2011 instead of Advertisement No.04 of 2015 cut-off date on 01.08.2015 and consider the maximum age of the petitioner in general category for appointment to the post of Assistant Teacher in Government Primary School Class-I to Class-VIII. 
 4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has passed matriculation examination in the year 1986 in 1 st Division from Bihar School Examination Board, Patna, Intermediate from Ranchi University, Ranchi in the year 1988, B.Sc.(H) Examination from Ranchi University, Ranchi in the year 1993 and the petitioner has completed his Post Graduation from Ranchi University in the year 2006. The petitioner had earlier applied for the post of appointment of general category for the post of Assistant Teacher in Government of Jharkhand School for Class-I to Class-VIII on the basis of Advertisement No.27 of 2011 dated 26.03.2011. Thereafter, he also applied for appointment under Advertisement No.95 of 2012. The Government of Jharkhand came out with the notification for appointment by the Advertisement No.4/2015. In the said advertisement, there is relaxation of age for 5 years. The learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that in the year 2011 advertisement process relaxation up to 40 years of age whereas in the year 2015 it has been brought to 35 years of age and the cut-off in the year 2015 for counting the age under the 2015 advertisement, the cut-off date has been fixed on 01.08.2015. He further submits that due to delay on the part of the State, the petitioner has not been able to participate and in that view of the matter, the age relaxation3is required to be there so that the petitioner and others can apply. He relied in the order of Hon'ble Patna High Court passed in C.W.J.C No.20587 of 2019 and submits that by Patna High Court the age relaxation was rejected to be issued and in that view of the matter, the writ petition is fit to be allowed. 
 5. Per contra, Ms. Ruchi Rampuria, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent-State submits that underArticle 309of the Constitution of India, the recruitment rules and policy was framed by the Government of Jharkhand. The grievance of the petitioner relates to considering his age as per the publication made in the Advertisement No.27 of 2011 in which cut-off date for calculation of upper age limit was fixed on 01.07.2011. In view of that advertisement, the cut-off date reckoned as also 01.07.2011. The cut-off date is being provided for separate public advertisement. The first advertisement cannot be continued in all subsequent process of appointment. In view of Jharkhand Primary School Teachers Recruitment Rules, 2012 which prescribes clearance of Teachers' Eligibility Test [TET] and as per Rule No.13 thereof one-time measure relaxation was provided for 7 years. She submits that relaxation is the policy decision. The cut-off date fixed in the year 2015, i.e., 01.08.2015 is absolutely scientific and non-arbitrary. She submits that this matter has been set at rest in view of Division Bench judgment of this Court rendered in case of ""State of Jharkhand v. Kokila Devi & Ors."" in L.P.A. No.429 of 2014 and other analogous cases decided on 03.07.2017. She submits that Clause-V of Advertisement No.4 of 2015 minimum educational qualification has been fixed and in Clause-VII upper age limit for appointment was fixed as 01.08.2015. The petitioner attained the age of 43 years 11 months and 28 days on the cut-off date, i.e., 01.08.2015. The relaxation in upper age limit has been extended up4to 7 years for one time opportunity. The petitioner had already crossed the upper age limit and in that view of the matter no relief can be extended to the petitioner. 
 6. Mrs. Richa Sanchita, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent-JAC submits that the advertisement took place in the year 2015 whereas this writ petition has been filed in the year 2019. She further submits that all the process have already been completed and the candidates have been appointed and they are working. 
 7. Having heard the learned counsels appearing on behalf of the parties, the Court finds that there is subsequent advertisement in view of the policy decision of the Government and in the advertisement of 2015 the maximum age has been brought to 35 years and relaxation of 5 years is also there which is a policy decision of the Government. The contention of the petitioner is not acceptable in view of the fact that advertisement was also in the year 2015 and the candidates have already been appointed and working. The petitioner approached this Court in the year 2019 after completion of the entire exercise. The Court finds that there is no arbitrariness on the part of the State in fixing the cut-off date as 01.08.2015 pursuant to Advertisement No.4 of 2015 or contrary in law. The 5 years age relaxation has been given under Rule 13 of the Rules, 2012. 
 8. Under the facts and circumstances of the present case, the Patna High Court judgment is not applicable. A reference may be made to the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court rendered in the case of ""Govt. of A.P. v. N. Subbarayudu"" reported in (2008) 14 SCC 702. Paragraph nos.5 to 9 of the said judgment are quoted hereinbelow: 
 5. In a catena of decisions of this Court it has been held that the cut-off date is fixed by the5executive authority keeping in view the economic conditions, financial constraints and many other administrative and other attending circumstances. This Court is also of the view that fixing cut-off dates is within the domain of the executive authority and the court should not normally interfere with the fixation of cut-off date by the executive authority unless such order appears to be on the face of it blatantly discriminatory and arbitrary. (See State of Punjab v. Amar Nath Goyal.) 
 6. No doubt inD.S. Nakara v. Union of Indiathis Court had struck down the cut-off date in connection with the demand of pension. However, in subsequent decisions this Court has considerably watered down the rigid view taken in Nakara case as observed in para 29 of the decision of this Court inState of Punjab v. Amar Nath Goyal. 
 7. There may be various considerations in the mind of the executive authorities due to which a particular cut-off date has been fixed. These considerations can be financial, administrative or other considerations. The court must exercise judicial restraint and must ordinarily leave it to the executive authorities to fix the cut-off date. The Government must be left with some leeway and free play at the joints in this connection. 
 8. In fact several decisions of this Court have gone to the extent of saying that the choice of a cut-off date cannot be dubbed as arbitrary even if no particular reason is given for the same in the counter-affidavit filed by the Government (unless it is shown to be totally capricious or whimsical), videState of Bihar v. Ramjee Prasad,Union of India v. Sudhir Kumar Jaiswal(vide SCC para 5),Ramrao v. All India Backward Class Bank Employees Welfare Assn. (vide SCC para 31),University Grants Commission v. Sadhana Chaudhary, etc. It follows, therefore, that even if no reason has been given in the counter-affidavit of the Government or the executive authority as to why a particular cut-off date has been chosen, the court must still not declare that date to be arbitrary and violative ofArticle 14unless the said cut-off date leads to some blatantly capricious or outrageous result. 
 
 9. As has been held by this Court inAravali Golf Club v. Chander Hassand inGovt. of A.P. v. P. Laxmi Devithe court must maintain judicial restraint in matters relating to the legislative or executive domain. 
 
 9. In view of the aforesaid decision, the cut-off date prescribed by the Government of Jharkhand in Advertisement No.4 of 2015 cannot be quashed and this Court is not inclined to re-fix any cut-off date. The examination process is already over. As a cumulative effect of the above discussions, no relief can be extended to the petitioner, and hence, the writ petition [W.P.(S) No. 617 of 2019] stands dismissed. 
 10. I.A., if any, stands disposed of.

 1. Anandi Mitra @ Anadi Nath Mitra @ Anadi Mitra. 
 Since the prayer made in all these applications are common, same are being disposed of by this common order. 
 All the petitioners apprehend their arrest in connection with Ghatshila P.S. Case No. 70 of 2019 for offences undersections 406,420,467,468,471/34of the Indian Penal Code. 
 The allegations reveal that the office bearers of Ghatshila Advocate Association instead of depositing the income of the association in the bank account had kept it with themselves and have consequently misused the funds. It has been alleged that the office bearers also failed to show the statement of account in spite of repeated insistence by the members. The Governing Body had constituted a five members committee, which on enquiry came to a conclusion of defalcation of Rs.50,00,000/-. It has further been alleged that the allegations were substantiated on an audit conducted by the Jharkhand State Bar Council. 
 The petitioners in A. B.A. No. 485 of 2020 were the President and the Secretary of Ghatshila Bar Association at the relevant point of time. So far as-2-petitioner in A.B.A. No. 1660 of 2020 is concerned, he was the Vice President and the petitioner in A.B.A. No. 670 of 2020 was the Assistant Treasurer. 
 Mr. Amit Kumar Das, learned counsel for the petitioners in A. B.A. No. 485 of 2020, has submitted that the petitioners have falsely been implicated only on account of the fact that they were the President and Secretary of Ghatshila Bar Association at the relevant point of time. He has submitted that during demonetization, some amounts were kept by the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer and in spite of repeated meetings including the meetings of the Executive Committee as well as the General Body, the Treasurer had never deposited the amount and had kept it with him in stead of in the account of the association. He also submitted that the petitioners had acted promptly and had sought for an explanation from the Treasurer as to why in spite of undertaking given by him, the amount was not deposited and in fact the petitioners had persistently made efforts to ensure that the amount in question is deposited by the Treasurer. It has been submitted that the FIR was instituted in a hurry and the matter could have been resolved by the Jharkhand State Bar Council itself. It has further been submitted that petitioner no. 1 is a reputed lawyer and senior most member of the Ghatshila Bar Association and petitioner no. 2 is the Secretary and is a dignified practioner. 
 Mr. Manish Kumar, learned counsel for the petitioner in A.B.A. No. 1660 of 2020, has submitted that the petitioner was the Vice President of the Association at the relevant point of time and was nowhere involved in taking any policy decisions or any decision regarding the finances of the Association. He has submitted that the said petitioner is practicing since long and has a good reputation and infact the entire gamut of allegations are concentrated around the Treasurer who had admitted to have kept the amount with him. 
 Mrs. Ritu Kumar, learned counsel for the petitioner in A.B.A. No. 670 of 2020, has submitted that initially the Treasurer as well as the petitioner who was the Assistant Treasurer at the relevant point of time were directed by the members to deposit the amount. She has submitted that the petitioner had regularly deposited the amounts, which were collected in the bank account, for which reference has been made to some bank slips as brought on record in the supplementary affidavit. She has also referred to a letter issued by the petitioner that the amount which was in possession of the petitioner has been handed over to the Treasurer. Learned counsel submits that on account of demonetization, the petitioner was constrained to keep certain amount of money, which however, was handed over to the Treasurer and in such circumstances, therefore, this petitioner also cannot be proceeded against in a criminal case. 
 Learned A.P.Ps. have opposed the prayer for anticipatory bail of the petitioners and have submitted that the amounts defalcated relate to an Association of Advocates and the petitioners in various capacities were required to ensure that the funds of the Association are appropriately handled and on account of the lax attitude of the petitioners, such a huge defalcation had taken place in the accounts of the Association. 
 The arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the respective parties have been considered and the case diary which has been received has also been perused. It appears that an Executive Committee Meeting was held on 15.12.2017, in which it was detected that the cash kept with the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer was to the tune of Rs.15,40,945/-. Both the said persons were directed to deposit the amount in the account of the Association immediately. An explanation was sought for by the President and General Secretary of Ghatshila Bar Association from the Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer vide communication dated 19.01.2018 for not depositing the amount within the designated date. It appears that the Treasurer namely Rajmal Tudu had made a communication on 24.1.2018, through which he had assured that the entire amount will be deposited in the account of the Association. The petitioner in A.B.A. No 670 of 2020 had informed the President and Joint Secretary of the Association vide letter dated 24.01.2018 that the amount which was kept with him has been handed over to the Treasure Rajmal Tudu. The Minutes of the General Body Meeting dated 30.05.2018 has also been brought on record, from which it appears that the Treasurer Rajmal Tudu had admitted to have Rs.6,70,000/- in his possession, which he undertook to deposit within 15 days. He had also assured that the rest amount will also be deposited. Before the General Body Meeting held on 30.05.2018, a written undertaking was given by the Treasurer. The office bearers of the Association had once again reminded the Treasurer of his undertaking to deposit the amount of Rs.6,70,000/- and his failure to do so and he was therefore once again directed to deposit the said amount before the final audit of the Bar Association is taken up. The audit reports have also been brought on record in A.B.A. No. 485 of 2020. 
 In the case diary, the statements of some of the members of Ghatshila Bar Association have been recorded, in which the allegations seem to have been supported. The said statements find place at paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of the case diary. Answering to the notice issued undersection 41A of Cr.P.C., the Treasurer had put the entire blame regarding the defalcation upon other office bearers. All the petitioners had submitted their respective explanations undersection 41Aof Cr.P.C. as would be evident from a bare perusal of the case diary. 
 From the entire facts, enumerated above, the pivotal role regarding the defalcation is primarily played by the Treasurer-Rajmal Tudu. The petitioners were the office bearers of Ghatshila Bar Association in various capacities. No doubt, it is true that the supervisory role of the petitioners has not been properly executed by them which perhaps emboldened the Treasurer to indulge in embezzlement of a huge amount belonging to the Association. The petitioner- Sujit Kumar Panda in B.A. No. 670 of 2020 had promptly deposited the amount, which he had kept with him and for which a plausible explanation has also been submitted regarding the demonetization having come into existence though such retention of money was itself unauthorized. 
 The Minutes of various meetings brought on record are suggestive of the acceptance of the Treasurer regarding the huge amount kept with him. Repeatedly, assurances were given by the Treasurer for complying with the directives of the President, Secretary as well as the Executive Members of Ghatshila Bar Association and the decision of the General Body but the Treasurer seems to have made a volte face while replying to the notice undersection 41Aof Cr.P.C. as he had given a totally contradictory stand in the said reply, although he has been consistent on being confronted by various office bearers in the meeting that it was he who had kept the amount with him and had undertaken to deposit the said amount in the account of the Association. 
 The facts and circumstances of the case, as enumerated above, thus indicate that the petitioners have been implicated in the present case only on account of their holding the post of office bearers in various capacities at the relevant point of time and since the Treasurer had accepted to have kept the amount with him and it would be assumed that the amount has been defalcated since it was not deposited in the account of Ghatshila Bar Association in spite of repeated assurances, the petitioners deserve to be granted anticipatory bail. 
 Accordingly, all the petitioners, named above, are directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, they will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- ( Ten thousand only) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ghatshila in connection with Ghatshila P.S. Case No. 70 of 2019, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 These applications stand allowed.

 2. Heard Mr. Sanjeev Thakur, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party no. 2. 
 3. Heard Mr. Arup Dey, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party- State. 
 4. Learned Amicus Curiae submits that for the purposes of imposition of punishment underSection 125Code of Criminal Procedure on account of non-payment of monthly allowance, there is a prescribed maximum period of punishment of one month only and in the instant case, a petition was filed upon default of three months and the learned court below imposed punishment for 15 days on each month and thus, exceeded one month's punishment. She further submits that subsequent punishment of 15 days for default of each subsequent month was also imposed without there being any separate application or interlocutory application by the opposite party no. 2 alleging non-payment of maintenance. She submits that such order passed by the learned court below cannot be sustained in the eyes of law and defeats the ends of justice. She has relied upon the judgements passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in AIR 2014 SC 24 (para 4 and 5) and (1989) 1 SCC 405. She also2submits that the judgement passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Shahada Khatoon is very clear. She submits that the judgement passed by the Hon'ble Gujarat High Court holding that one month's punishment shall be imposed for each month's default, does not apply to the facts and circumstances of this case and is contrary to the decision of the apex court in the case of Shahada Khatoon. 
 5. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party no. 2 has relied upon the judgement passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of ""Shantha @ Ushadevi & Anr. Vs. B.G. Shivananjappa"" reported in (2005) 4 SCC 468 and has submitted that it has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that it must be borne in mind thatSection 125of Code of Criminal Procedure is a measure of social legislation and it has to be construed liberally for the welfare and benefit of the wife and daughter and accordingly, it is unreasonable to insist on filing successive application when the liability to pay the maintenance as per the order passed underSection 125(1)Cr.P.C. is a continuing liability. However, during the course of argument, the learned counsel has also submitted that when a single petition was filed upon default of continuous three months, then the maximum punishment which could have been awarded by the learned court was for one month only . 
 6. Learned counsel for the opposite party- State has also supported the arguments advanced on behalf of the opposite party no. 2. 
 7. Arguments are concluded. 
 8. Judgement is reserved.

 Ms. Ritu Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that there is apparent delay of six months in lodging the FIR, which smacks of malafide.

Since petitioners did not join the duties, they have been dragged in a false case in order to pressurize them. 
 Ms. Vandana Bharti, leaned APP vehemently opposes the prayer for bail of the petitioners. Learned APP submits that this is a serious case where custodian of the money has defalcated the same. The Banking business runs on trust and once trust is questioned, the entire system may collapse.

Learned counsel further argues that from perusal of offence report it would be evident that petitioners have neither present at the place of occurrence nor anybody has seen them cutting the stone at the place of occurrence.

Learned counsel further argues that there is no likelihood of their absconding, if the petitioners are enlarged on anticipatory bail.

As per the CDR, on the alleged date and time of occurrence, the tower locations of mobile phones of the petitioners were not found at the place of occurrence nor they were present there and as such, no such occurrence took place. There is delay of 3 days for lodging the First Information Report, which creates doubt upon the prosecution story.

 Heard Mr. Gaurav, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Prabhu Dayal Agrawal, learned APP for the State. 
 Mr. Gaurav, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is innocent and he has been falsely implicated in the instant case. The petitioner has not committed any offence as alleged in the First Information Report. The petitioner has been made an accused in the present case merely on the basis of suspicion and doubt raised by unknown persons, which has no evidentiary value in the eyes of law. He further submits that in course of investigation, victim has never disclosed that she was kept in the house of the petitioner against her will or she was kept there for sending her to Delhi. In absence of any substantive piece of evidence, informant has implicated the petitioner. The prosecution has not produced any evidence with regard of human trafficking of victim girl. He further submits that petitioner is ready to abide by any terms and conditions imposed by this Hon'ble Court for grant of anticipatory bail. Hence, the petitioner may be given the2privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned APP opposes the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail and submits that accused-petitioner is named in the FIR and the allegation leveled against him is serious in nature. He further submits that in course of investigation, the prosecution witnesses including informant have fully supported the indulgence of this very accused in the alleged crime. Hence, this petitioner may not be granted the privilege of anticipatory bail.

 Heard Mr. Kumar Harsh, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Suraj Verma, learned APP for the State. 
 Mr. Kumar Harsh, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is innocent and he has been falsely implicated in the instant case. The petitioner is the owner of the seized Tractor bearing registration No.JH-09 B 8106/8108 and is engaged in a business of transportation of goods. The seizure list produced by the prosecution presumes to be inappropriate and erroneous as seizure list shows that about 31.7 ton of coal was found loaded on the above Tracktor and it is impracticable for a tractor trailer to bear a load of 31.7 ton of coal. There is no material evidence on record to establish the guilt of the petitioner in connection with the purport of illegal trading of coal. He further submits that petitioner is ready to abide by any terms and conditions imposed upon him by this Hon'ble Court for grant of anticipatory bail. Learned counsel lastly argues that co-accused, namely Deepak Yadav, driver of the vehicle has already been granted2anticipatory bail by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court in A.B.A. No. 2593 of 2020.

 The petitioner is an accused for allegedly committing offence punishable underSections 341,323,504,307of the Indian Penal Code. 
 The petitioner is in custody since 14.10.2019. The dispute arose between two neighbours in relation to a Mango Tree. Seven stitches were planted on the victim because of the injury, which was inflicted upon the victim. Charge sheet has already been submitted in this case. 
 Considering the period of custody and the fact that charge sheet has already been submitted in this case, I am inclined to enlarge the petitioner on bail. Accordingly, petitioner, named above, is directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (ten thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of Sessions Judge, Palamau at Daltonganj in connection with Sadar P.S. Case No. 148-2-of 2017 [G.R. No. 2405/2017, S.T. No. 16/2020]. 
 Further, I direct the Jail Authority that before releasing the petitioner from jail, the Jail Authority should get the petitioner tested for COVID-19. If the report is positive, then the District Administration will immediately take steps to isolate the petitioner and get him treated in the COVID Center by following all the protocols. 
 This direction is given in the larger public interest and it should not be construed as a condition of bail.

 The petitioner apprehending his arrest in connection with the case registered underSection 33of the Indian Forest Act and Sections 4/5/8/9 of the Jharkhand Kendu Leaves (control of trade) Act, 1973 has prayed for grant of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has been falsely implicated in this case and has not committed any offence as alleged in the F.I.R. Even on perusal of the prosecution report, it would be evident that 146 sacks of Kendu leaves were recovered from behind the house of the petitioner. Thus, it cannot be said that the said recovery has been made from the house premises of the petitioner much less from his conscious possession. Hence, the petitioner may be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned Spl. P. P. opposes the petitioner's prayer for anticipatory bail. Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, I am inclined to enlarge the petitioner on anticipatory bail. Accordingly, the above named petitioner is directed to surrender before the concerned Court below within a period of four weeks. If he surrenders before the Court below within the aforesaid period, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail-bond of Rs.20,000/- (twenty thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Hazaribagh in connection with G (F) Case No. 271/2017 with the conditions that the petitioner will co-operate in the investigation of the case and will appear before the Investigating Officer as and when noticed by him.

 The petitioners apprehending their arrest in connection with Jasidih P.S. Case No. 419 of 2017 corresponding to G.R. No. 1946 of 2017 registered underSections 147/149/341/323/504/447/448/380/307/337of the Indian Penal Code, have prayed for grant of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners have been falsely implicated in the present case and have not committed any offence as alleged in the F.I.R. There is a case and counter case between the parties. The entire allegation levelled against the accused persons including the petitioners in the written report of the informant is concocted and they have been implicated in this case due to previous enmity. Hence, the petitioners may be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned A.P.P. while opposing the petitioners' prayer for anticipatory bail submits that so far as the petitioner no. 3-Sikander Yadav is concerned, there is direct allegation against him that he gave iron rod blow on the head of the informant. As per memo of evidence received from the Investigating Officer, the injury inflicted upon the informant is grievous in nature. 
 Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and keeping in view that there is direct allegation of assault against the petitioner-2-no.3 - Sikander Yadav, I am not inclined to grant him the privilege of anticipatory bail. Hence, his prayer for grant of anticipatory bail is hereby rejected. 
 So far as the petitioner no.1- Surendra @ Suresh Yadav, petitioner no. 2- Dharmendra Yadav and the petitioner no. 4- Baijnath Yadav @ Baijnath Mahto are concerned, I am inclined to enlarge them on anticipatory bail. Accordingly, they are directed to surrender before the concerned court below within four weeks from today. In the event of their arrest/surrender before the concerned court below within the aforesaid period, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.20,000/- (twenty thousand only) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Deoghar in connection with Jasidih P.S.

 Order No. 02 Dated 09th September, 2020 Heard the learned counsel for the respective sides. The petitioners apprehend their arrest in connection with Lesliganj P.S. Case No. 145 of 2018. 
 The daughter of the informant was abducted by Dilip Kumar and she was taken to Punjab where she was subjected to rape. It has been alleged that Dilip Kumar returned back to the village and kept the daughter of the informant confided. 
 The petitioners are the parents of Dilip Kumar who are alleged to have facilitated the abduction. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the entire gamut of allegation points towards Dilip Kumar of taking away the minor girl of the informant to Punjab, committing rape upon her and thereafter bringing her back to the village. Learned counsel submits that on the very next day after Dilip Kumar and the girl returned, the father of the girl had come to the house of the petitioners and had taken away the girl with him. It has been stated that since the petitioners are the parents of Dilip Kumar, they are alleged to have facilitated the enticement. 
 Learned APP has opposed the prayer for anticipatory bail made by the petitioners. 
 The role of the petitioners being the parents of Dilip Kumar appears to be very limited. The same also is diluted in view of the fact that on the very next day the victim girl was taken away by her father and therefore it cannot be said that the petitioners were involved in confining the victim. So far as the allegation of rape is concerned, the same is levelled against Dilip Kumar and that too when he had enticed away the girl and taken her to Punjab. 
 Regard being had to the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioners. The petitioners accordingly are directed to surrender before the learned court below within four weeks from today and2.on such surrender, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Special Judge (POCSO), Palamau at Daltonganj, Palamau at Daltonganj in connection with Lesliganj P.S.

 So far as defect no. 9 (i) is concerned, learned counsel for the petitioner undertakes to remove the same, once the situation normalizes. As regards, defect no. 9 (ii) is concerned, the same is ignored. 
 The petitioner is apprehending his arrest in connection with Belbadda P.S. Case No. 68 of 2020. 
 It has been alleged that the informant was abused and assaulted by brandishing him a witch due to which several persons suffered injuries. 
 It has been stated that a proceeding underSection 144Cr.P.C. had been initiated between the informant and the son in which the petitioner no. 1 and 2 as well as some other persons were the second parties. The said proceeding was subsequently dropped. It further appears that the father of the petitioner no. 1 has also lodged a case against the brother of the informant which was registered as Belbadda P. S. Case No. 69 of 2020. 
 Learned counsel for the informant has stated that three persons have suffered grievous injuries and the case was found to be true for the offence under Section 307 I.P.C. 
 On a perusal of FIR, it appears that the petitioner no. 2 has been attributed to have assaulted Ram Bilash Thakur with a lathi on his hand and so far as the other petitioners are concerned, the allegations are general and omnibus in nature. It appears that there are a plethora of-2-cases between both the sides on account of previous enmity existing between the parties. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. 
 Accordingly, the petitioners above named are directed to surrender in the court below within four weeks and pray for bail, and in that event, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each, to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate 1st class, Godda in connection with Belbadda P.S. Case No. 68 of 2020, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Codeof Criminal Procedure.

 The Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the allegation against the petitioner is that the petitioner solemnized marriage with the complainant by suppressing the fact that he was earlier married. It is further alleged that at the time of marriage as per the demand of the petitioner and his parents, from the side of the complainant household articles worth of Rs.3,00,000/- and jewelry worth of Rs.2,50,000/- and Rs.12,70,000/- through Demand Draft and Rs.1,00,001/- in cash as sagoon was given to the petitioner and his family members. It is further alleged that after the marriage, the petitioner and his family members started taunting the complainant for the gift items, jewelry, clothes and other articles brought by her and from next day of marriage onwards, the petitioner started mentally torturing the complainant. After 15 days of the marriage, the petitioner and his relatives demanded further amount of Rs.10,00,000/- and a new car. It is also alleged that the petitioner resorted to all kind of physical and mental harassment to the complainant after taking to her house at his work place at Kolkata because of non-fulfillment of the said additional demand of Rs.10,00,000/- and new car by her parents. It is next alleged that the complainant was badly beaten by the petitioner and the complainant was not provided food and locked in room after being assaulted. It is also alleged that petitioner being a habitual drunkard used to come to his house in a drunken state in the night and regularly used to beat the complainant causing her multiple injuries. It is further alleged that the complainant came to know that the petitioner tortured and divorced his first wife namely Payal Kaschap @ Payal Kashap because of non-fulfillment of dowry demand by her and ultimately the complainant was driven out from the house of the petitioner after being assaulted by the petitioner. It is next alleged that upon execution of bond by the petitioner, the complainant again went to the house of the petitioner after filing an informatory petition before C.J.M., Ranchi but the ill-treatment continues and the complainant could know that the petitioner after entering into a conspiracy with his relatives, had taken the complainant to his house after execution of bond only for the purpose of killing her and as per their plan, the petitioner and his relatives started assaulting the complainant and kicked her out from the house of the petitioner. 
 It is further submitted that the allegation against the petitioner are all false and the petitioner has disclosed about her earlier marriage to the family members of the complainant, at the time of negotiation of marriage of the petitioner with the complainant. It is next submitted that the petitioner never executed any bond. It is also submitted that Rs.12,70,000/- in shape of Demand Draft was given at the time of negotiation of marriage to meet the expenses of the marriage and part of the said amount was used for purchasing gold ornaments and jewelries, therefore the petitioner is not ready and willing to return the same. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned Addl. P.P. and the learned counsel for the opposite party no.2 on the other hand vehemently opposed the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail and submitted that the habitual conduct of the petitioner of marrying girls only for the purpose of extracting money from their parents by way of dowry demand needs to be dealt with a heavy hand to curb the malady of the obnoxious practice of greedy males alluring unsuspecting parents of prospective brides by bending rules and the petitioner if enlarged on bail will indulge in similar type of offence spoiling the life of other ladies as well and there is every chance of the petitioner tampering with the evidence hence, it is submitted that the petitioner ought not to be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Considering the serious nature of allegation against the petitioner as well as the conduct of the petitioner, this Court is of the considered view that this is not a fit case where the petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. Accordingly, his prayer for anticipatory bail is rejected.

 Considering the same, this Court is inclined to hear the anticipatory bail application on merits, but with condition that petitioners shall remove the defects within 30 days after the physical court starts. 
 Joint Registrar (Judicial) is directed to ensure the compliance of this order after the physical court starts so as to remove the defects. 
 Heard, learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr. A.K. Chaturvedy and learned counsel for the State, Md. Hatim. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that petitioners are apprehending their arrest in connection with Itkhori P.S. Case No.102 of 2019, dated 26.09.2019, for the offence underSections 406,407and420/34IPC as 17 named accused persons are staff of Pragya Kendra and they have not deposited the money collected to the tune of Rs.1,41,82,073.40/- from the consumers. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that on the basis of the letter written by the higher authority, FIR has been lodged against 17 named-2-accused persons. Petitioner No.3- Vishal Jain has deposited the entire amount of Rs. 18,30,100/- vide Annexures-2 and 2/1 and to that effect no objection has been issued.

 Learned counsel for the State has opposed the prayer for bail and has submitted that from perusal of FIR it will be apparent that how the 17 staff of Pragya Kendra have defalcated the huge amount. It appears that some of the petitioners have deposited the amount and some of the petitioners have deposited part of the amount but such huge amount would have fetched interest in a considerable figure. Learned counsel for the State has further submitted that Electricity Board may be added as a party so as to know the correct position of defalcated amount.

 So far as defect no. 9 (i) is concerned, learned counsel for the petitioners undertakes to remove the same once the situation normalizes. As regards defect no. 9 
 (ii) is concerned, same is ignored. 
 The petitioners apprehend their arrest in connection with Rajnagar P.S. Case No. 31 of 2020. 
 It has been alleged that the petitioner no. 1 had attempted to commit rape upon the informant. Petitioner no. 1 had also attacked the sister in law of the informant and when the family of the informant decided to report the incident to the police, the accused persons variously armed had assaulted them. It has further been alleged that Nandlal Mandal and Sadanand Mandal had suffered several blows. One of the petitioners also seem to have lodged an FIR being Rajnagar P.S. Case No. 32 of 2020. 
 Although it has been submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the matter has been compromised between the parties but considering the nature of allegations levelled against petitioner nos. 1 and 2, I am not inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to them. Their prayer for anticipatory bail is accordingly rejected. 
 However, so far as petitioner no.-3- Binapani Tripathy @ Maa is concerned, taking a considerate view of the fact that she is a lady, she is directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, she will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- ( Ten thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned S.D.J.M, at Seraikella in connection with Rajnagar P.S.

 Defects stand ignored. 
 Heard learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and counsel for the State, who opposes the prayer for bail of the petitioner. 
 The petitioner is an accused for allegedly committing offence punishable underSections 307of the Indian Penal Code andSection 25(1- B)(a) 26, 27, 35 of theArms Act. 
 The petitioner is in custody since 26.03.2020 and charge sheet has already submitted in this case. From the possession of this petitioner a pistol has been recovered. Though there is allegation of firing but who has fired, has not been mentioned. Further, the petitioner is also an accused in another case, i.e. Sahigbgand (M) P.S.

If the report is positive, then the District Administration will immediately take steps to isolate the petitioner and get him treated in the COVID Center by following all the protocols. 
 This direction is given in the larger public interest and it should not be construed as a condition of bail.

 Heard learned counsel appearing for the petitioners and learned A.P.P appearing for the State through video conferencing. 
 The learned counsel for the petitioner personally undertakes to remove the defects as pointed out by the stamp reporter, within two weeks after the lockdown period is over. 
 In view of the personal undertaking of the learned counsel for the petitioners, the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter are ignored for the present. 
 Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the allegation against the petitioner is that the petitioner in furtherance of his common intention with the co-accused persons attempted to murder Suraj Yadav, Sanjeet Yadav and Sunny Yadav and also outraged the modesty of the daughter-in-law of the informant and also fired from firearms upon the informant. It is submitted that the allegation against the petitioner is false.

 Learned A.P.P appearing for the State opposes the prayer for anticipatory bail of the petitioner. 
 Considering the submissions of learned counsels and the facts and circumstances stated above, I am inclined to grant privileges of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. Accordingly, the petitioner is directed to surrender in the Court of learned Additional District Judge -XVI, Dhanbad within six weeks from today and in the event of his arrest or surrendering, the petitioner will be enlarged on bail on depositing a demand draft of Rs.5,000/- as ad interim victim compensation without prejudice to his defence in this case drawn in favour of the informant and on furnishing bail bond of Rs.25,000/- (Twenty five thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Additional District Judge -XVI, Dhanbad in connection with Tetulmari P.S.

 Apprehending their arrest, the petitioners have moved this Court for grant of privilege of anticipatory bail in connection with Patratu (Barkakana) P.S. Case No.36 of 2020 registered undersections 379of the Indian Penal Code, under section 21 of M.M.D.R. Act and under section 54 of J.M.M. (Concession) Rules, 2004. 
 Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and learned Spl. P.P. for the State through video conferencing. 
 The learned counsel for the petitioners personally undertake to remove the defects as pointed out by the stamp reporter, within two weeks after the lockdown period is over. 
 In view of the personal undertaking of the learned counsel for the petitioners, the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter are ignored for the present. 
 The Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the allegation against the petitioners is that the petitioners were running crusher without licence and huge quantity of boulders and stone chips were recovered from the crusher run by the petitioners. It is further submitted that the allegation against the petitioners are false. Some persons inimical to the petitioners have given their name deliberately to harass them and the petitioners have no connection with the alleged crusher or storage of stones. It is then submitted that the petitioner no.3 is an old man of 70 years of age and is suffering from several ailments. It is next submitted that the petitioners have no criminal antecedent as has been mentioned in paragraph no.11 of the anticipatory bail application. It is lastly submitted that the petitioners are ready and willing to furnish sufficient security including cash security and undertake to cooperate with the investigation of the case. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioners be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned Spl. P.P. opposes the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail. 
 Considering the submissions of the counsels and the fact as discussed above, I am of the opinion that it is a fit case where the above named petitioners be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. Hence, in the event of their arrest or surrender within a period of eight weeks from the date of this order, they shall be released on bail on the petitioner no.1 depositing cash security of Rs.20,000/-, petitioner no.2 depositing cash security of Rs.10,000/-, petitioner no.3 depositing cash security of Rs.25,000/- and petitioner no.4 depositing cash security of Rs.12,000/- and on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ramgarh, in connection with Patratu (Barkakana) P.S. Case No.36 of 2020 with the condition that the petitioners will cooperate with the investigation of the case and appear before the Investigating Officer as and when noticed by him and will furnish their mobile numbers and a copy of their Aadhar Cards in the court below with the undertaking that they will not change their mobile number during the pendency of the case subject to the conditions laid down under section 438 (2) Cr.

 Learned counsel for the petitioner undertakes to deposit the deficit court fee within two weeks from today. Rest of the defects stand ignored. 
 Heard learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and counsel for the State, who opposes the prayer for bail of the petitioner. 
 The petitioner is an accused for allegedly committing offence punishable underSections 366(A)of the Indian Penal Code and Section 8 of POCSO Act. 
 The victim is aged about 17 years. Her statement has been recorded underSection 164Cr.P.C., where she stated that she knew that this petitioner is already married and having a child. She further stated that she on her own will left the house and contacted this petitioner, who first evaded the victim but, thereafter, he came and put vermilion on her head. 
 Considering the statement of the victim, recorded underSection 164Cr.P.C., I am inclined to enlarge the petitioner on bail. Accordingly, petitioner, named above, is directed to be released on bail on furnishing-2-bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (ten thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of Additional Sessions Judge-I, Ramgarh in connection with Patratu P.S. Case No. 35 of 2020 [Spl. POCSO Case No. 13/2020]. 
 Further, I direct the Jail Authority that before releasing the petitioner from jail, the Jail Authority should get the petitioner tested for COVID-19. If the report is positive, then the District Administration will immediately take steps to isolate the petitioner and get him treated in the COVID Center by following all the protocols. 
 This direction is given in the larger public interest and it should not be construed as a condition of bail.

 Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that a false case has been instituted by the police against several named accused persons and several accused persons have been granted anticipatory bail by the Court, as such, petitioner, who has no criminal antecedent, may also be enlarged on bail. 
 Learned counsel for the State, M/s.

 Learned counsel for the State has further submitted that some of the accused persons have been granted anticipatory bail by Coordinate Bench of this Court, but the anticipatory bail of co- accused Santosh Keshri has been rejected by Coordinate Bench of this Court in terms of order dated 24.02.2020 passed in A.B.A. No.251/2020, as such, this application may also be dismissed. 
 Considering the rival submissions of the parties, there is dispute with regard to the maintainability of the application, as such, this Court directs State counsel to file a detail counter affidavit with regard to the maintainability, criminal antecedent and material collected during investigation. 
 Since some of the co-accused have been granted anticipatory bail by Coordinate Bench of this Court and anticipatory bail of one Santosh Keshri has been refused, as such, this Court is inclined to grant interim protection to the petitioner so as to distinguish the case of the petitioner with the co-accused who have been granted anticipatory bail and compare with the case of Santosh Keshri, who has been refused anticipatory bail by a Coordinate Bench of this Court.

 05/ 09.09.2020 Heard learned counsel for the appellant and learned counsel for the NIA. 
 2. This appeal is directed against the order dated 14.1.2019, passed in Misc. Cr. Application No. 1189 of 2019, arising out of Balumath P.S. Case No. 225 of 2018 [Special (NIA) Case No. 01 of 2019, RC-13/2019/NIA/DLI], whereby the bail application of this appellant was dismissed by the learned Judicial Commissioner-cum-Special Judge (NIA), Ranchi, (herein after referred to as the 'NIA Court'). 
 3. The appellant was apprehended from a forest along with other co-accused persons on a tip-off to the police, from where, heavy number of arms and ammunitions, including prohibited arms were recovered. From the possession of this appellant, 15 round live cartridges of 5.56 mm bore were recovered, apart from two mobile phones and pamphlets relating to PLFI. Accordingly, Balumath P.S. Case No. 225 of 2018, was instituted for the offences underSections 25(1A),26(2)(2),35of the Arms Act, Sections 17(I)(ii) of CLA Act andSections 10and13of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and the apprehended accused persons, including this appellant were taken into custody. 
 4. Subsequently the investigation of the case was handed over to the NIA. After investigation, the charge sheet has been submitted by the NIA, which shows the involvement of the appellant was also found in the terrorist activities including demanding levy for the terrorist organization. The charge-sheet has been submitted by the NIA also for the offences underSections 384,385,386and387of the Indian Penal Code, read withSection 120-Bof the Indian Penal Code, andSections 17,18(b)and20of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. 
 5. Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the impugned order passed by the NIA Court, cannot be sustained in the eyes of law, inasmuch-2-as, so far as the present appellant is concerned, there is recovery of only 15 cartridges from his possession, which cannot be said to be prohibited arms. Learned counsel also submitted that the appellant has been falsely implicated in the case, and he has remained in custody for more than one year and 9 months and, accordingly, has prayed for bail. 
 6. Learned counsel for the NIA, on the other hand, has opposed the prayer and has drawn our attention towards the materials collected by the NIA during the investigation of the case, which show the involvement of the appellant in the terrorist activities and the demand of levy for the terrorist organization, including the overt acts for collecting the levy. Learned counsel has also drawn our attention towardsSection 43-D(5) of theUnlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, which reads as follows:- 
 ""43-D (5) Notwithstanding anything contained inthe Code, no person accused of an offence punishable under Chapters IV and VI of this Act shall, if in custody, be released on bail or on his own bond unless the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity of being heard on the application for such release: 
 Provided that such accused person shall not be released on bail or on his own bond if the Court, on a perusal of the case diary or the report made undersection 173of the Code is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against such person is prima facie true."" 
 7. Placing reliance on this provision and drawing our attention towards the materials showing the involvement of the appellant in the terrorist activities and collection of levy for the terrorist organization, learned counsel for the NIA submits that there is no illegality in the impugned Judgment, passed by the NIA Court, whereby the prayer of the appellant for bail has been rejected. 
 8. Having heard learned counsels for both the sides and upon going through the record and also the materials produced before us by the learned counsel for the NIA, we are of the considered view that on the basis of exhibited materials, it cannot be said that the allegations against the appellant are not prima facie true. Once we come to this conclusion,Section 43-D(5)of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, operates as a bar for the relief sought for. 
 9. Accordingly, we do not find any illegality in the impugned Judgment, passed by the NIA Court below, rejecting the prayer for bail of the appellant. There is no merit in this appeal and the same is accordingly, dismissed.

 Mr. Rahul Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that petitioners are innocent and they have been falsely implicated in this case. The whole allegation in F.I.R. is false, concocted and has been manufactured to implicate the petitioners in this frivolous case. Learned counsel submits that there is no specific allegation against the petitioners rather, all the allegations are levelled against one Sanjay Prasad. Learned counsel further argues that the petitioners are law abiding citizens and by no stretch of imagination, they can even think to commit the offence as alleged in the F.I.R. Learned counsel further argues that there is no likelihood of their absconding, if the petitioners are enlarged on anticipatory bail. 
 Mr. Suraj Verma, learned APP vehemently opposes the contention of the petitioners. 
 In the facts and circumstances, I am inclined to enlarge the petitioners on bail. 
 Hence, in the event of arrest by the police or surrender before the Court below within a period of four weeks from today, the petitioners named above shall will be enlarged on bail on furnishing bail bonds of Rs.20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand) each, with two sureties of the like amount each, to the satisfaction of learned J.M. 1st Class, Ramgarh, in connection with Gola P.S.

He further submits that when the petitioner filed a case before this Hon'ble High Court, wherein vide order dated 16.01.2019 and 07.11.2019, a direction was given to file counter- affidavit, then the Opposite party had filed this FIR on 13.12.2019 and as such, the action of the concerned authorities is completely arbitrary and mala fide.Section 409of the Indian Penal Code is not made out against the petitioner. Learned Sr. counsel further submits that due to in-action of concerned authorities, the petitioner has been suffering mentally and physically. Petitioner is a reputed person of the society and if, he is taken into custody, his image will be tarnished. There is no chance of2absconding of the petitioner or tampering with the evidence of the prosecution.

Hence, the petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail.

 Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, I am inclined to grant the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. Hence, in the event of arrest by the police or surrender before the learned court below within a period of eight weeks' from the date of this order, the petitioner shall be enlarged on bail on depositing of Rs.2,00,000/- (Two Lakhs) by way of demand draft drawn in favour of the District Welfare Officer, Sahibganj as cash security, within a period of two months from today and furnishing bail bond of Rs.20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand) with two sureties of like amount each to the satisfaction of officer concerned, in connection with Borio (J) P.S.

 The petitioner is apprehending his arrest in connection with Kuru P.S Case No.159 of 2018 for the offences registered underSections 414and34of the Indian Penal Code, pending before the Court of learned ACJM, Lohardaga. 
 Heard Mr. Rajesh Kumar, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Suraj Verma, learned APP for the State. 
 Mr. Rajesh Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is innocent and he has been falsely implicated in the instant case by the informant. The petitioner has not committed any offence as alleged in the FIR. There is no evidence to prove that the loaded coal in said Hywa was stolen property and there is no case of theft of said coal and as such,Section 414of the Indian Penal Code is not applicable to this case. The petitioner is driver of seized Hywa Vehicle being JH 01 DD 6416. He further submits that owner of the said Vehicle has already been granted anticipatory bail by the learned Sessions Judge, Lohardaga in A.B.P No. 254 of 2018. The said Hywa Vehicle has already been released in favour of the owner and coal was also released since the coal was loaded in the vehicle was with valid papers. He further submits that petitioner is ready to abide by any terms and conditions imposed upon him by this Hon'ble Court for grant of anticipatory bail. Hence, the petitioner may be given the privilege of2anticipatory bail. 
 Learned APP opposes the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail. 
 Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, I am inclined to grant the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. Hence, in the event of arrest by the police or surrender before the learned Court below, within a period of four weeks' from the date of this order, the petitioner, named above shall be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand) with two sureties of like amount each to the satisfaction of officer concerned, in connection with Kuru P.S Case No.159/2018, subject to the conditions laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

 The petitioner apprehending his arrest in connection with the case registered underSections 341/342/323/337/338/153(A)/504/34IPC has prayed for grant of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has been falsely implicated in this case and has not committed any offence as alleged in the F.I.R. Even if the content of the written report of the informant is taken to be true, it has been alleged that co-accused Bulbul Sah took sword from the petitioner and started pelting stones on the persons of other community. No specific allegation of assault has been attributed against the petitioner. Hence, the petitioner may be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned A.P.P opposes the petitioner's prayer for anticipatory bail. Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, I am inclined to enlarge the petitioner on anticipatory bail. Accordingly, the above named petitioner is directed to surrender before the concerned Court below within a period of four weeks. If he surrenders before the Court below within the aforesaid period, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail-bond of Rs.20,000/- (twenty thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Deoghar in connection with Karon P.S.

 Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners have been falsely implicated in the present case and have not committed any offence as alleged in the F.I.R. The petitioners have not at all scuffled with or assaulted the police party as has been alleged. Even if the allegation made in the written report is taken to be true, it would be evident that the petitioners had some scuffle with the police party and one lady Chowkidar namely Arti Devi sustained injury in her hand. It is further submitted that exceptSection 353of the I.P.C., all the offences levelled against the petitioners are bailable in nature, hence they may be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned A.P.P. opposes the petitioners' prayer for anticipatory bail. Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstance, I am inclined to enlarge the petitioners on anticipatory bail. Accordingly, the petitioners, above named, are directed to surrender before the concerned court below within four weeks from today. In the event of their arrest/surrender before the concerned court below within the aforesaid period, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.20,000/- (twenty thousand only) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the Judicial Magistrate-1st Class, Hazaribag in connection with Chauparan P.S.

 2/09.09.2020 Heard the parties. 
 So far as defect no. 4 is concerned, learned counsel for the petitioner undertakes to remove the same, once the situation normalizes. As regards, rest defects are concerned, the same are ignored. 
 The petitioner is apprehending his arrest in connection with Patratu P.S. Case No. 11 of 2020 registered for the offences underSections 498A,341,323,34I.P.C. read with Section 3 & 4 of D. P. Act and Section 4 of Muslim Women (Protection of Marital Right) Act 2019. 
 The marriage of the informant was solemnized with the petitioner on 17.01.2010. It has been alleged that when the petitioner went abroad, the in-laws had tortured her. It has further been alleged that the petitioner by pronouncing triple talaq had divorced her, which led to institution of the case. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is still ready and willing to keep the opposite party no. 2 with full dignity and honour. He has stated that the children are with him and he is maintaining them. 
 However, the same has been opposed by Mr. M. I. Khan, learned counsel for the opposite party no. 2 and who has stated that in spite of she being in a financial crunch, she is maintaining the children. 
 Considering the nature of allegations levelled against the petitioner moreso with respect to unilaterally giving triple talaq, I am not inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. 
 Accordingly, this application stands rejected.

 The petitioner is apprehending his arrest in C.P. Case No. 3772 of 2018 for the offence punishable underSection 498-Aof the Indian Penal Code, pending in the court of the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Dhanbad. 
 The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has been falsely implicated in the present case and has not committed any offence as alleged in the complaint. The petitioner has neither tortured nor has made any demand of dowry from the complainant. The petitioner is a person of limited means and since he could not satisfy the repeated demands of the complainant, he has been roped in the present case along with the family members. The complainant herself has refused to rejoin the marital relationship with the petitioner and hence, he may be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 The learned A.P.P. while opposing the petitioner's prayer for anticipatory bail submits that on perusal of the solemn affirmation of the complainant recorded by the concerned court below, it would be evident that she was taken by the petitioner to her ""mayka"" (her parents' home) saying that till she fulfills the demand of Rs. 1,00,000/-, she would not be taken back to the matrimonial home. The petitioner being the husband of the complainant and there being specific allegation against him, may not be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, I am not inclined to enlarge the petitioner on anticipatory bail. Hence, the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail of the petitioner is hereby rejected.

 Counsel for the petitioner submits that both, i.e. the victim and her mother have been examined and both of them have been declared hostile. 
 This is a case underSection 376IPC. It is true that the victim, who is aged about 8-9 years and her mother have been declared hostile, but the impugned order clearly suggests that the Doctor has found recent sign of sexual assault on the victim, who is aged about 8-9 years. The FIR categorically alleges commission of rape by this petitioner upon the victim, who is aged about 8-9 years. This clearly suggests that there is some element of tampering with the evidence that's why the victim and her mother, who is the informant, have become hostile. 
 Considering the aforesaid fact, I am not inclined to enlarge the petitioner on bail. Accordingly, his prayer for bail is hereby rejected.

 The petitioners are accused in a case registered underSections 498Aand34of the Indian Penal Code andSection 3/4of the Dowry Prohibition Act. 
 Mr. Arbind Kumar Choudhary, learned counsel for the petitioners, submits that the petitioners have been falsely implicated in the present case and have committed no offence as alleged in the first information report. The petitioner no.1 is father-in-law, petitioner no.2 is mother-in- law and petitioner no.3 is Nandosi of the informant. There is general and omnibus allegation against the petitioners.

So far as the main accused- Bablu Das (husband of the informant) is concerned, he is already in judicial custody. The said fact has been stated in paragraph no.10 of the present anticipatory bail application. Hence, the petitioners may be given the privilege of anticipatory of bail. 
 Mr. Rakesh Ranjan, learned APP, appears on behalf of the State and opposes the petitioners' prayer for anticipatory bail. 
 Having heard learned counsel for the parties, I am inclined to grant the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioners. Accordingly, in the event of their arrest or surrender before the court below within a period of four weeks, the petitioners, above named, are directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.20,000/- (rupees twenty thousand), each, with two sureties of the like amount, each,-2-to the satisfaction of learned Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Madhupur in connection with Madhupur (Mahila) P.S.

 It has been alleged that four tractors which were illegally transporting sand were intercepted and seized. 
 The petitioners appear to be the owners of two seized tractors. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the vehicles were entrusted to the driver and the petitioners were never aware about the illegality being committed by the drivers in transporting illegally extracted sand. 
 The petitioners admittedly were not present at the place of occurrence, as they were the owners of the concerned tractors. 
 Regard being had to the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioners. The petitioners accordingly are directed to surrender before the learned trial court within four weeks from today and on such surrender, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Chatra in connection with Mayurhand P.S.

 The present case is taken up through video conferencing. 
 At the request of the learned counsel for the petitioner, the defects, as pointed out by the office, are ignored. 
 Heard learned counsel for the parties. 
 The petitioner apprehending his arrest in connection with Arki P.S. Case No. 28 of 2020 registered underSections 270,272of the Indian Penal Code andSection 47(A) of Excise Act pending in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Khunti, has prayed for grant of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has been falsely implicated in the present case and has not committed any offence as alleged in the F.I.R. There is no recovery of any country-made liquor from conscious possession of the petitioner. The petitioner has been roped in the present case merely on the suspicion and hearsay statements of the villagers. In fact, the petitioner has never been involved in manufacturing of illicit country-made liquor. Hence, the petitioner may be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned A.P.P. while opposing the petitioner's prayer for anticipatory bail submits that there is recovery of 120 ltrs. illicit Mahua (country-made) liquor contained in jerry cans from the house of the petitioner as would be evident from the seizure list dated 02.04.2020. 
 Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, I am not inclined to enlarge the petitioner on anticipatory bail. Accordingly, his anticipatory bail application is hereby rejected.

In response to the said letter of the Ranchi University, the Professor-in- Charge of RLSY College, vide its Letter No.58/2014 dated 24.03.2014, replied to the Registrar, Ranchi University- Respondent No.5 giving the details of arrears with respect to the teachers for the period from 01.01.2006 to 30.3.2010 under the 6th UGC Pay taking into consideration the annual increment of the petitioner. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that on 21.08.2014 he also sought information under the Right toInformation Actfrom the University in respect of reply of the Professor-in-Charge of the college given to the University. Pursuant to that, the Public Information Officer, Ranchi University, Ranchi, in his reply dated 26.09.2014 had given the information which clearly transpires that the dues to be paid to the petitioner was amounting to Rs.11,43,137/- and therefore, she is entitled for the said amount along with statutory interest, if any. 
 4. A counter affidavit has been filed by the University (Respondent No. 4 and 5), from which it clearly transpires that the case of the writ petitioner was examined and upon examination of records, it was found that a sum of Rs.8,77,943/- is admissible in total towards UGC arrears for the period from 01.01.2006 to July, 2009. 
 5. Mr. A.K. Mehta, learned counsel for the University submits that the entire amount of Rs.8,77,943/-, which was admissible, has already been paid to the petitioner in the manner as stated in Paragraph 4 (i) & (ii) of the aforesaid counter affidavit. 
 6. However, a rejoinder has been filed in this case by the petitioner reiterating her stand that the petitioner has received an information underR.T.I Actthat the amount due, which is to be paid to the petitioner, was more than Rs.11 lakh, whereas, she has been paid less than nine lakh. 
 7. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and after going through the materials on record, it appears that though the college where the petitioner was working has submitted a statement of arrears of 10 teachers for the period from 01.01.2006 to 30.03.2010, wherein it has been indicated that the amount due in case of the present petitioner is Rs.11,43,137/-, but from the specific assertion made by the Ranchi University in its counter affidavit, it appears that the case of the petitioner was examined and it was found upon examination of records that a sum of Rs.8,77,943/- only was admissible in total towards UGC arrears for the period from 01.01.2006 to July, 2009 and the same has been paid to the petitioner. The calculation made by the Ranchi University towards payment of UGC arrears has also been annexed as Annexure A series with its counter affidavit. 
 8. It is a settled principle of law that a writ court cannot enter into the question of fact and do the work of calculation. As such I, hereby, dispose of the writ application by giving liberty to the petitioner to represent before Respondent No. 5 with a detailed calculation; if so advised. 
 It goes without saying that if any such representation is filed by the petitioner; the same shall be-4-disposed of by a reasoned order by providing a detailed calculation within a period of three months from the date of receipt of such representation. Needless to say that if any amount is found to be payable after re-calculation, then the same shall be paid to the petitioner forthwith along with statutory interest. 
 9. With the aforesaid observation and direction this application is disposed of.

 07/10.09.2020. Heard Mr. Diwakar Upadhyay, the learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Rahul Kamlesh, learned counsel for the respondent-State. 
 This writ petition has been heard through Video Conferencing in view of the guidelines of the High Court taking into account the situation arising due to COVID-19 pandemic. None of the parties have complained about any technical snag of audio-video and with their consent this matter has been heard on merit. 
 The petitioner has preferred this writ petition for quashing the order dated 16.10.2017 contained in Annexure-13 passed by the Director General of Police, Government of Jharkhand, Ranchi, whereby, the revision application preferred against the order passed by the Inspector General of Police, South Chhotanagpur Division, Ranchi dated 19.01.2012 has been affirmed. 
 The petitioner was appointed on 15.06.1984 on the post of Sub-Inspector of Police. On 19.04.2006, the wife of the petitioner died and the allegation was against the petitioner that he has shot his wife. First Information Report was2registered against the petitioner as Bariatu P.s. Case No. 59 of 2006, corresponding to G.R. No. 1301 of 2006 for the alleged offence underSection 302of the Indian Penal Code andSection 27of the Arms Act. The petitioner was taken into custody by the investigating authority. The petitioner was suspended from service on 29.04.2006. The show-cause was issued to the petitioner for the alleged offence of murdering his wife. The petitioner replied to the same to the effect that the matter is pending before the trial court and prayed that during the pendency of the trial, the departmental proceeding may be kept in abeyance. On 23.01.2006, a recommendation was made by the Sub-Divisional Police Officer-cum-Conducting Officer and forwarded a letter to the Senior Superintendent of Police, Ranchi requesting therein that the reply to the show- cause has been received, in which, the delinquent has prayed for keeping the departmental proceeding in abeyance, till the trial is concluded by the learned trial court. In the meantime, the petitioner was convicted and sentenced the petitioner to undergo life imprisonment in the said case vide judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 11.05.2007 and 14.05.2007 respectively. Thereafter, the petitioner preferred a criminal appeal being Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 586 of 2007 before this Court, which was allowed and the petitioner was acquitted from the charge vide judgment dated 07.06.2017. 
 Mr. Diwakar Upadhyay, learned counsel for the petitioner assailed the impugned order on the ground that in the departmental proceeding, inquiry report was submitted only on the ground that the petitioner has been convicted by the trial court and without adducing any evidence in the departmental proceeding, the inquiry report was submitted. He further submits that the petitioner was not given any opportunity in the departmental proceeding and in that view of the matter, the departmental proceeding was against the principle3of natural justice. He also submits that in view of Annexure-5, which is a medical certificate, the petitioner was admitted in Ranchi Institute of Neuro-Psychiatry & Allied Sciences (RINPAS), Ranchi as he was suffering from mental illness (Schizophrenia). During the treatment of the petitioner, the departmental proceeding was concluded on 17.05.2010. From the medical certificate contained in Annexure-5, it appears that during that period the petitioner was being treated in RINPAS. He further submits that the petitioner was acquitted in the criminal case by the order of this Court and, thereafter, he has filed a revision application, which was rejected by the Director General of Police, Ranchi contained in Annexure-13 on the ground that the High Court has not directed for reinstatement in service while acquitting the petitioner in the criminal case. He further submits that it is well known that in the criminal case, the order of reinstatement in service cannot be passed. 
 Per contra, Mr. Rahul Kamlesh learned counsel for the respondent-State submits that the petitioner has been acquitted on technical ground. He further submits that his acquittal was not on contest and in that view of the matter, the petitioner cannot be reinstated in service. He also submits that the departmental proceeding and criminal proceeding are two different subjects and parameters of both the proceedings are different. Merely on the ground that the petitioner has been acquitted in the criminal case by the High Court, the case of the petitioner cannot be considered for reinstatement. He further submits that on this ground, there are judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. 
 Having heard learned counsel for the parties, the Court finds that in the departmental proceeding when the inquiry report was submitted, the petitioner was being treated in RINPAS, which is apparent from Annexure-5. In the inquiry report contained in Annexure-6, this aspect of the matter has been accepted that4the petitioner was being treated in RINPAS and that is why reply to the show- cause has not been received. Only on the ground of conviction by the trial court, the inquiry report has been submitted saying that the petitioner is found guilty. After acquittal by the High Court in the criminal case, the Director General of Police has rejected the revision application of the petitioner on the ground that the High Court has not directed for reinstatement of the petitioner in service while acquitting the petitioner in the criminal case. It is well known that the High Court while acquitting the petitioner has decided the criminal case only and the authority concerned has to consider the reinstatement of the petitioner in service while passing a reasoned order. From the inquiry report, it transpires that the petitioner was being treated in RINPAS and the inquiry report has been submitted only taking into consideration this aspect of the matter that the petitioner has been convicted by the trial court. The reason assigned by the Director General of Police, Ranchi while rejecting the claim of the petitioner does not sound good. 
 In view of the above facts, the writ petition succeeds and, accordingly, the impugned order dated 16.10.2017 contained in Annexure-13 passed by the Director General of Police, Ranchi is quashed. The matter is remitted back to the Director General of Police, Ranchi to consider the case of the petitioner afresh and pass a reasoned order. 
 With the aforesaid observation and direction, this writ petition stands allowed and disposed of.

 I.A. No.4399 of 2020 6/10.09.2020 Heard learned counsel for the appellant and learned counsel for the State on the interlocutory application filed by the appellant for granting bail during the pendency of the appeal. 
 The appellant has been convicted and sentenced for the offences underSections 307,353,414of the Indian Penal Code andSection 27(2)/35of the Arms Act and Section 17 of the CLA Act.

 Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the appellant has remained in custody for more than five years and has prayed for bail-2-submitting that in the similar circumstances, other co-accused has been granted bail by order dated 8.6.2020 in I.A.

 The stamp reporter has submitted that Sections 13 (1), 13(4), 34 and 35 of the SARFAESI (Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest) Act, 2002 as well as Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure may be perused, which reads as follows:- 
 13. Enforcement of security interest.- 
 (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 69 orsection 69Aof the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882), any security interest created in favour of any secured creditor may be enforced, without the intervention of court or tribunal, by such creditor in accordance with the provisions of this Act. (4) In case the borrower fails to discharge his liability in full within the period specified in sub-section (2), the secured creditor may take recourse to one or more of the following measures to recover his secured debt, namely:- 
 (a) take possession of the secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale for realising the secured asset; 
 (b) take over the management of the business of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale for realising the secured asset: (c) appoint any person (hereafter referred to as the manager), to manage the secured assets the possession of which has been taken over by the secured creditor; 
 (d) require at any time by notice in writing, any person who has acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower and from whom any money is due or may become due to the borrower, to pay the secured creditor, so much of the money as is sufficient to pay the secured debt. 
 (B)Section 34- Civil Court not to have jurisdiction: 
 No civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of-2-any matter which a Debts Recovery Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal is empowered by or under this Act to determine and no injunction shall be granted by any court or other authority in respect of any action taken or to be taken in pursuance of any power conferred by or under this Act or under the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (51 of 1993). 
 (C)Section 35- The provisions of this Act to override other laws: 
 The provisions of this Act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law. 
 (D)Section 9- Courts to try all civil suits unless barred:- 
 The Courts shall (subject to the provisions herein contained) have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. 
 The report further submitted that as no decree was ever prepared, as such, order of the trial court dated 21.01.2019 must be deemed to have been passed under Order XIV Rule-2 CPC, dismissing the suit being barred by law. 
 Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that though he has not perused the report, but he has explained that as per Section 2 (2) of the CPC, decree has been defined in this way. 
 2 (2) ""decree"" means the formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as regards the Court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final. It shall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint and the determination of any question within section 144, but shall not include - 
 (a) any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an order, or 
 (b) any order of dismissal for default. 
 Learned counsel for the appellants has further submitted that since the decree is not required formally to be prepared, but the second appeal is maintainable. 
 Since, we are hearing through virtual court, it is difficult to decide the issue, as such, the case is ordered to be listed within 30 days after the physical court starts, so that, learned counsel for the appellants may also peruse the report submitted by Joint Registrar (Judicial) in compliance of the order dated 11.06.2020 passed by this Court and may file supplementary affidavit explaining the maintainability of the appeal. 
 Put up this case within 30 days after the physical court starts. The report submitted by Joint Registrar (Judicial) shall be kept on record.

 FOR THE PETITIONER(S) : Mr. Mukeh Kumar Mehta, Advocate FOR THE STATE : Mr. Ashok Singh, APP 
 ------ 
 06/10.09.2020 Defect(s) as pointed out by the office is ignored for the present. 
 Heard learned counsel for the parties through video conferencing. The lawyer have no objection with regard to the proceeding, which has been held through video conference today at 11.00 A.M. They have no complaint in respect to the audio and video clarity and quality. 
 In this application, petitioner has challenged the order dated 11.11.2019 by which process underSection 82Cr.P.C has been issued. 
 Counsel for the petitioner on earlier occasion when the case was argued, submitted that the order is absolutely cryptic and has not been passed in conformity with the provision ofSection 82Cr.P.C. He submitted that even the order-sheet does not suggest as to where and when the petitioner has to appear. 
 Considering the submission of the petitioner this court had called for the copy of the Form IV of theCr.P.C. After going through Form-IV of theCr.P.C. and the impugned order, I find that in the said Form-IV no date, time and place has been mentioned where petitioner has to appear in terms ofSection 82Cr.P.C. Neither in the order-sheet date, time and place has been mentioned nor in the Form IV. This Court in the case of Md. Rustum Alam @ Rustam & Ors. Vrs. State of Jharkhand in Cr.M.P No. 2722 of 2019 has held that order-sheet must reflect the date, time and place where the petitioner has to appear in terms of the process issued underSection 82Cr.P.C and non-recording and non-fixing of such date in the order-sheet will make entire order bad. 
 Considering the judgment passed in Md. Rustum Alam @ Rustam (supra) and also considering the fact that Form-IV does not reflect the date, time and place where the petitioner has to appear, I am inclined to allow this application setting aside the order dated 11.11.2019. 
 The matter is remitted to the court concerned to pass order afresh in accordance with law.

 2. This case was listed/supposed to be listed before the Lawazima Board of the Registrar General for seeking an order in respect of the defects, pointed out by the Office. 
 3. Considering the pandemic situation where the Court has minimized the footfall of the lawyers and their Clerks in the Court, this Court felt proper to get all the cases listed before this Court so that the defects can be looked into at this stage only. Thus, this case is listed today before this Court directly. 
 4. There are several defects and one of the defects is in respect of the Deficit Court Fee/Welfare Fee. Another defect is in relation to the case number etc. in first paragraph and prayer portion. 
 5. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner undertakes to deposit the deficit court fee/welfare fee within two weeks from today. He prays to ignore the rest of the defects and take up the matter on merits. 
 6. The Deficit Court Fee and the Welfare Fee will be deposited by the petitioner within two weeks. So far as the correct case number is concerned, according to the petitioner, the correct case number would be G.R. No.4344 of 2013 arising out of Nirsa Police Station Case No.305 of 2013 andthe Sections of the Indian Penal Codewould beSections 384,447,379,506and34of the Indian Penal Code. Office is directed to make necessary correction in paragraph 1 and prayer portion of the main criminal miscellaneous petition, as mentioned above. 
 7. Rest of the defects stand ignored. 
 8. Mr. Kalyan Banerjee, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that with malafide intention the present first information report has been registered. He submits that the petitioner being the driver, demanded his-: 2 :-legal dues for which this case has been registered. Further, he submits that the petitioner was not having a good mental health. 
 9. Aforesaid are grounds, which the petitioner has taken to quash the first information report being Nirsa Police Station Case No.305 of 2013 and order taking cognizance dated 19.06.2018. 
 10. First Information Report was registered underSections 384,447,379,506and34of the Indian Penal Code. From the first information report, I also find that the petitioner was not the driver of the informant, rather he was driver of some other person, namely, Abhimanyu Singh. Police investigated the case and filed chargesheet. The Court below, thereafter, by an order dated 19.06.2018 took cognizance of the offence underSections 341,323,456,504,506,34of the Indian Penal Code. Police did not find it to be a case of extortion. The Court below took cognizance and issued summons finding materials against the petitioner. Thus, I find no material in this criminal miscellaneous petition, so as to entertain the same. This criminal miscellaneous petition is, accordingly, dismissed. 
 11. The petitioner will be at liberty to raise all the points in his defence at an appropriate stage.

 In view of the personal undertaking of the learned counsel for the petitioners, the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter are ignored for the present. 
 Apprehending their arrest, the petitioners have moved this Court for grant of privilege of anticipatory bail in connection with Doranda P.S. Case No.01 of 2020 registered undersections 419/420/467/468/471/120Bof the Indian Penal Code. 
 The Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the allegation against the petitioners is that petitioners by making forged genealogical table sold the entire share of land of the informant by executing sale deed without her consent or knowledge and the genealogical table was prepared by deleting the name of the ancestor of the informant namely Bandhan Gosai.

It is then submitted that the petitioners are ready and willing to cooperate with the investigation of the case. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioners be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned Spl. P.P. on the other hand vehemently opposes the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail of the petitioner no.1 and submits that he is a habitual offender and is involved in 11 cases hence his custodial interrogation is required during the investigation of the case. It is therefore submitted that, the petitioner no.1 ought not to be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Considering the serious nature of allegation against the petitioner no.1 namely Bhola Gosai as well as the requirement of his custodial interrogation during the investigation of the case, this Court is of the considered view that this is not a fit case where the petitioner no.1 be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. Accordingly, his prayer for anticipatory bail is rejected. 
 So far as the petitioner no.2 -Vikash Singh is concerned it appears that he is only a witness of the sale deed, hence I am of the opinion that it is a fit case where the above named petitioner no.2 be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. Therefore, in the event of his arrest or surrender within a period of four weeks from the date of this order, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned J.M., Ranchi, in connection with Doranda P.S.

Thus, this case is listed today before the Court directly. 
 4. The defect(s), as pointed out by the office, stand ignored for the present. 
 5. Heard the counsel for the parties. 
 6. The petitioner has confined his prayer and only challenged the order dated 11.9.2018 by which, prayer of the petitioner to send the agreement, which is Ext.2, to the handwriting expert, has been dismissed, as the petitioner is disputing the signature on the said agreement. Aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner had preferred a revision petition being Cr. Revision Case No. 75/2018, which was dismissed vide order dated 27.9.2019. 
 7. Counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has the right to rebut the presumption and thus, it was necessary to send the agreement before the handwriting expert. 
 8. This case arises out of a complaint for the offence underSection 138N.I. Act alleging therein that two cheques bearing Cheque Nos. 078165 and 078166 of United Bank of India were issued by the petitioner, which were dishonoured. The defence of the petitioner is that he lost his cheque for which, a Sanha was also lodged. It is the further case of the petitioner that the agreement, which the complainant is relying upon, does not bear his signature and thus there was no occasion to hand over the cheque to the complainant pursuant to any agreement. 
 9. After going through the impugned order as well as the records, I find that the petitioner has not disputed his signature on the cheques. When the petitioner has not disputed his signature on the cheque, the relevancy of the agreement, whether the same has been signed by the petitioner or not, is not of any importance. It is the petitioner, being an accused, has to prove that there were no legal dues upon him. The onus is upon the petitioner as to whether he has issued the cheque to the complainant against any legal dues or not. The complainant has discharged the onus which was upon him .The facts with regard to dishonour of cheques and signature on the cheques by the petitioner are not disputed. The agreement, in fact, has got no relevancy at this stage. 
 10. Thus, I find no merit in this petition. Accordingly, the same is dismissed."

 The defect(s) as pointed out by the office stand ignored for the present. Heard the counsel for the parties. 
 The petitioner in this petition, has challenged the order dated 3.7.2019, by which, cognizance of the offence punishable under Section(s) 419, 420, 467, 468 and 471of the Indian Penal Code, has been taken by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ranchi, in connection with Hindpiri P.S. Case No. 91/2017 and thereafter the petitioner has been summoned. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the order impugned is cryptic and is a non speaking order and does not reflect any subjective satisfaction as to what are the material to take cognizance against he petitioner. He submits that the requirement ofSection 204Cr.P.C has not been dealt with in the impugned order. 
 Learned A.P.P opposes the prayer of the petitioner but after going through the order impugned, he cannot justify the order impugned. 
 After going through the record and the order impugned, I find that the order is absolutely cryptic and non-speaking and is not in conformity with the judgment passed by this Court in the case of Amresh Kumar Dhiraj and Ors. Vs. State of Jharkhand and Another, reported in 2020 (1) JLJR 199 (Jhr.). What are the materials against the petitioner to proceed, has also not been mentioned. Thus, the impugned order dated 3.7.2019 is, hereby, set aside. The matter is remitted to he court below to pass a fresh order in accordance with law. 
 Accordingly, this petition stands allowed."

He submits that the impugned order is absolutely cryptic and non- speaking. He submits that the Court below, while passing the impugned order has not mentioned anything as to what are the materials to issue summons to the petitioner. 
 8. After hearing the counsel for the parties, I have gone through the impugned order. While I go through the impugned order, I find that the same is absolutely cryptic and non speaking order. There is nothing in the impugned order to suggest as to what are the materials against the petitioner so as to-: 2 :-proceed against him. This Court in the case of Amresh Kumar Dhiraj and Others versus State of Jharkhand & Another reported in 2020 (1) JLJR 199 (Jhr.) has passed a detailed order discussing the provisions of issuing process underSection 204of the Code of Criminal Procedure and order taking cognizance.

 6. The petitioners, in this criminal miscellaneous petition, have challenged the order dated 07.02.2019 passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Koderma in Satgawan Police Station Case No.61 of 2017 (G.R. No.1171 of 2017), by which cognizance has been taken underSection 307of the Indian Penal Code after differing from the Chargesheet submitted by the police. 
 7. Learned counsel for the petitioners challenges the impugned order on the ground that though chargesheet was not submitted under Section-: 2 :-307of the Indian Penal Code, yet the Court below has taken cognizance of the offence underSection 307of the Indian Penal Code by differing from the chargesheet, but, without assigning any reasons. She submits that injuries are simple in nature and the offence underSection 307of the Indian Penal Code is not attracted in this case. 
 8. After hearing the counsel for the parties, I have gone through the records and the impugned order. After going through the impugned order, I find that the same is absolutely cryptic and non speaking order. From the records and the impugned order, it is apparent that chargesheet was not submitted underSection 307of the Indian Penal Code, yet the Court below took cognizance of the offence underSection 307of the Indian Penal Code by differing from the chargesheet submitted by the police. It is well settled that while differing from the chargesheet submitted by the police, it is incumbent upon the Court to assign reasons. From the impugned order, I find that no reasons have been assigned for differing with the chargesheet submitted by the police. Further, I find that it has also not been mentioned in the impugned order as to what are materials which attracts the aforesaid Section. Moreover, I also find that there is nothing in the impugned order to suggest as to what are the materials against the petitioner so as to proceed against them. Thus, the impugned order is a non-speaking and not in consonance with the order/judgment of this Court in the case of Amresh Kumar Dhiraj and Others versus State of Jharkhand & Another reported in 2020 (1) JLJR 199 (Jhr.) wherein this Court has passed a detailed order discussing the provisions of issuing process underSection 204of the Code of Criminal Procedure and order taking cognizance. 
 10. In view of the aforesaid facts, I find that the impugned order is prima facie bad, having been passed without recording any material for differing with the chargesheet submitted by the police or without recording as to what are the materials against the petitioners so as to proceed against them and thus, being not in consonance with the provisionsof the Codeof Criminal Procedure and the law laid down in the case of Amresh Kumar Dhiraj (supra), exercising jurisdiction underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure, I hereby quash and set aside the impugned order dated 07.02.2019 passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Koderma in Satgawan Police Station Case No.61 of 2017 corresponding to G.R. No.1171 of 2017. The matter is remanded to the Court below for proceeding afresh and passing-: 3 :-orders in accordance with the provisions of law after taking into consideration the materials on record.

 4. There are several defects and one of the defects is in respect of the Deficit Court Fee. 
 5. Learned counsel for the petitioners undertakes to deposit the Deficit Court Fee within two weeks. He prays to ignore the rest of the defects and take up this matter on merits. 
 6. Accordingly, save and except the Deficit Court Fee, the rest of the defects stand ignored for the present. 
 7. The petitioners, in this criminal miscellaneous petition, pray for quashing the order dated 01.06.2019 passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Dumka in Dumka (T) Police Station Case No.99 of 2017 (G.R. No.487 of 2017), which is a composite order of taking cognizance of the offence underSections 406/420/34of the Indian Penal Code and issuing summons. 
 8. Mr. A.K. Kashyap, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that there is no criminal offence is made out and the entire transaction is civil in nature. He submits that to recover money from the petitioners, the present criminal case has been filed by the opposite party-: 2 :-No.2. He submits that the impugned order is absolutely cryptic and non- speaking. He submits that the Court below, while passing the impugned order has not mentioned anything as to what are the materials to issue summons against the petitioner. 
 9. After hearing the counsel for the parties, I have gone through the impugned order. While I go through the impugned order, I find that the same is absolutely cryptic and non speaking order. There is nothing in the impugned order to suggest as to what are the materials against the petitioner so as to proceed against him. This Court in the case of Amresh Kumar Dhiraj and Others versus State of Jharkhand & Another reported in 2020 (1) JLJR 199 (Jhr.) has passed a detailed order discussing the provisions of issuing process underSection 204of the Code of Criminal Procedure and order taking cognizance. The impugned order is not in consonance with the aforesaid order. 
 10. In view of the aforesaid facts, I find that the impugned order is prima facie bad, having been passed without recording any material against the petitioner so as to proceed against him and thus, being not in consonance with the provisionsof the Codeof Criminal Procedure and the law laid down in the case of Amresh Kumar Dhiraj (supra), exercising jurisdiction underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure, I hereby quash and set aside the impugned order dated 01.06.2019 passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Dumka in Dumka (T) Police Station Case No.99 of 2017 corresponding to G.R. No.487 of 2017. The matter is remanded to the Court below for proceeding afresh and passing orders in accordance with the provisions of law after taking into consideration the materials on record. 
 11. This criminal miscellaneous petition is, accordingly, allowed.

 Learned counsel for the petitioner undertakes to deposit the deficit court fee, if any, within two weeks from today. Rest of the defects stand ignored. 
 Heard the parties. 
 The petitioner, in this application, has prayed to quash the FIR being Tundi P.S. Case No. 30 of 2019, registered for the offence punishable underSections 498A of the Indian Penal Code andSection 3/4of the Dowry Prohibition Act. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the wife has taken the entire money, thus, the FIR has to be quashed. He further submits that till date charge sheet has not been submitted. 
 It is well settled principle of law that if cognizable offence is made out, the FIR cannot be quashed. While I go through the FIR, I find that there is allegation of demand of dowry and payment of the same. There is further allegation of torture physically and mentally upon the informant, which is apparent from bare perusal of the FIR itself. 
 Considering the aforesaid fact, I find no ground to quash the FIR. Accordingly, this criminal miscellaneous petition stands dismissed. 
 However, the petitioner would be at liberty to raise all the points, which have been raised in this petition, at an appropriate stage.

Their names also found place in Register-II maintained in the concerned circle office and rent receipts have also been issued in their favour from time-to-time. The claim of the petitioner is that since he along with other legal heirs of Late Jogeshwar Mandal are also coming in the genealogical table of the said recorded raiyats, they are also entitled for payment of the awarded compensation in lieu of acquisition of the land being done at the instance of the respondent- National Highways Authority of India for the purpose of widening (four laning) of National Highway No.-32.

 03/10.09.2020 This case was listed/supposed to be listed before the Lawazima Board for seeking an order in respect of the defect(s), pointed out by the office. 
 Considering the pandemic situation where the court has minimized the footfall of the lawyers and their clerks in the court, this court felt proper to get all the cases listed before this Court so that the defect(s) can be looked into at this stage only. Thus, this case is listed today before this Court directly. 
 Defect(s) as pointed out by the office is ignored for the present With the consent of the parties, the matter is taken up for hearing on merits. Heard learned counsel for the parties through video conferencing. The lawyer have no objection with regard to the proceeding, which has been held through video conference today at 11.00 A.M. They have no complaint in respect to the audio and video clarity and quality. 
 In this application, petitioners have challenged the order dated 18.9.2014 by which non-bailable warrant of arrest has been issued. He further challenged the orders dated 15.6.2019 and 14.01.2020 by which process underSection 82Cr.P.C and attachment order underSection 83Cr.P.C have been issued. 
 After going through the impugned order, I find that non-bailable warrant of arrest has been issued is in utter violation of provision ofSection 73Cr.P.C as none of the pre-conditions has been followed. So far as orders issuing processes underSection 82&83Cr.P.C are concerned the same are cryptic and do not even reflect any subjective satisfaction. 
 Considering the aforesaid fact, since the orders are cryptic and non- speaking and do not conform with the provision of law, the orders dated 18.9.2014, 15.6.2019 and 14.01.2020, are hereby, set aside. 
 Accordingly, the instant petition stands allowed. 
 The matter is remitted to the court below to pass a fresh order in accordance with law.

 It has been alleged the minor daughter of the informant went missing. 
 In the 164Cr.P.C. statement of the victim she has stated that she became acquainted with the petitioner through Instagram. The relationship blossomed and both decided to get married. On 09.02.2020 the petitioner was called by her to Giridih and both went by train to Rajasthan. She has stated that she stayed there for seven days. She has further stated that the petitioner had not forced her to go to Rajasthan. 
 It appears from the 164Cr.P.C. statement of the victim that she has played a predominant role in asking the petitioner to come to Giridih and thereafter both had gone to Rajasthan. The victim has categorically denied about any force having been used by the petitioner. The petitioner is in custody since 23.02.2020. 
 Regard being had to the above, the petitioner, named above, is directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail-2-bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each, to the satisfaction of learned Special Judge, POCSO Act, Giridih in connection with Nagar P.S.

 Order No.07 Date: 11.09.2020 
 1. This case is taken up through video conferencing. 
 2. The present writ petition has been filed for quashing the order as contained in memo no.705/GO dated 26th April, 2020 passed by the Sub Divisional Magistrate, Dhalbhum, Jamshedpur- respondent no.2 with a further direction to the respondents to remove the seal from ""The Alcor Hotel"", situated at Holding No.4, Ramdas Bhatta, opposite Indian Oil Petrol Pump, Bistupur, Jamshedpur, District East Singhbhum (hereinafter to be referred as 'the said premises'). 
 3. The factual background of the case as stated in the writ petition is that the petitioner owns the Hotel Alcor, which provides facilities such as restaurants, bar, spa etc. On 25th April, 2020, a first information report being Bistupur P.S. Case no.87 of 2020 was registered underSections 188,269&270of the Indian Penal Code;Section 54of the Disaster Management Act, 2005; andSection 3of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, alleging that during the lockdown period, a raid was conducted on 25th April, 2020 in the Hotel Alcor wherein it was found that the spa was opened and few people including two girls were present in the conference hall, adjoining the spa. Seeing the raiding party, some persons fled away, however, three persons were apprehended on spot. Thereafter, the said premises was sealed on 26th April, 2020 by the Special Officer, Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee and the Executive Magistrate-cum-Incident Commander, East Singhbhum, Jamshedpur in terms with the office order as contained in memo no.705/GO dated 26th April, 2020 passed by the respondent no.2. Another first information report, being Bistupur P.S. Case no.88 of22020 was registered underSections 3,4,5&6of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 against one of the Directors of the petitioner- Company, namely, Rajiv Singh Dugal and other accused persons on 27th April, 2020, alleging therein that one Sharad Poddar had kept a lady, namely, Aishwarya Tarak Singh in the said hotel for last one month and had been establishing physical relationship with her since then. The petitioner vide letter dated 7th May, 2020 requested the Deputy Commissioner, East Singhbhum, Jamshedpur- respondent no.1 to unseal the hotel premises, so that day to day business of the petitioner-Company and firms having their registered offices located at Alcor Hotel Premises could function in a regular manner. The copies of the said letters were also sent to other authorities, however, no action in this regard was taken. The petitioner also served a reminder vide letter dated 15th May, 2020 to the respondent no.1, however, the same was also not responded. Hence the present writ petition. 
 4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner was neither given any opportunity of hearing nor any lawful proceeding was initiated against it before sealing the entire premises of the said hotel. It is further submitted that there are offices of several companies/firms situated in the premises of the Hotel Alcor and by sealing the entire premises, functioning of the said offices are adversely affected for not fault on their part. There are about 475 direct and indirect employees involved with the said companies/firms and due to sealing of the entire premises, they are on the verge of starvation. It has become difficult for the petitioner-Company/firms situated in the said premises to carry on their respective business due to sealing of the entire premises leading to a situation that the salary of its employees is not being paid. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that even if the entire story of the prosecution in both the criminal cases are taken to be true on their face value, the said allegations do not in any manner reveal the involvement of the aforesaid companies/firms in which said Rajiv Singh Dugal is either Director or partner and hence the sealing of the office premises situated in the said hotel building is absolutely illegal. It is also submitted that even otherwise the said premises has not been sealed in connection with the investigation with respect to the said two criminal cases. In fact, the police has no power to seal an immovable3property under the provisionsof Codeof Criminal Procedure. Moreover, the Sub Divisional Magistrate-cum-Senior Incident Commander does not have the power under theDisaster Management Act, 2005 (hereinafter to be referred as 'the Act, 2005') or under any other law to seal an immovable property. Even assuming that there was a violation of certain norms of lockdown and thereby the orders issued under the Act, 2005 were violated, the immovable property of the petitioner could not have been sealed by any authority under the said Act. Sealing of an immovable property for an indefinite period that too without initiating any proceeding or providing any opportunity of hearing is grossly disproportionate and contrary to law. The action of the respondents in not communicating the order dated 26th April, 2020 by which the immovable property of the petitioner in question has been sealed is violative of Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. Both the first information reports are completely false and baseless and till the investigation is over and the concerned accused persons are not found guilty by facing trial, it shall be presumed that they are innocent and, therefore, the order to seal the property is completely unwarranted. It is further submitted that the initiation of the criminal proceedings under the provisions ofImmoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 against one of the Directors of the Company, whose name figured as an accused in Bistupur P.S. Case No.88 of 2020, has no bearing with the sealing of the premises, since the same was done prior to the institution of the aforesaid case. Though the criminal cases/first information reports have been instituted against few co-accused persons including the Director of the petitioner- Company, yet no criminal proceeding has been initiated against the petitioner-Company and as such the property belonging to the petitioner-Company cannot be subjected to any confiscatory proceeding. It is settled law that sealing of a property is confiscatory in nature and, therefore, it must be supported by the authority of law and any such action which does not find support from the statute cannot be allowed to continue. 
 5. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that an ex- 
 proprietary legislation should be construed strictly and even in the cases of directory requirements, the substantial compliance of such provision would be necessary. It is also submitted by the learned4counsel for the petitioner that the respondents are not authorized to seal the entire premises under the provisions of the Bihar (now Jharkhand) Excise Act, 1915, rather a suitable action by the excise authorities can be taken only to the extent of the bar premises. 
 6. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents submits that after the aforesaid incident, the said premises was sealed for collection of evidence and to desist anyone from tampering with the evidences available at the place of occurrence. The respondent no.2 after realizing the entire facts reached a conclusion that the management of the Hotel Alcor was continuously violating the orders/directions contained in Consolidated Revised Guidelines dated 15th April, 2020 issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India for the last many days and there was every possibility of violating the aforesaid directions in future and as such while exercising the power conferred to the said authority underSection 34read withSection 30of the Act, 2005 and in the capacity of being Senior Incident Commander, he ordered to seal the hotel premises until expiry of the period of the lockdown or till further orders. The respondent no.2 also asked the team constituted by it to collect evidences from the said premises. The police team, constituted under the orders of the Senior Superintendent of Police, Jamshedpur for proper and effective investigation of Bistupur P.S. Case no.87 of 2020 dated 25 th April, 2020, searched the entire premises on 26th April, 2020 including the rooms and CCTV footage and it was found that a lady, namely, Aishwarya Tarak Singh, resident of Kolkata, was residing in room no.402 of the said hotel. The police team collected several incriminating articles and electronic evidences, which, prima facie, indicated that flesh trade was going on in the said hotel during lockdown period. Consequently, Bistupur P.S. Case no.88 of 2020 dated 27th April, 2020 was lodged under the provisions ofImmoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, in connection of which five accused persons including the owner of the hotel were arrested and remanded to judicial custody. The police has filed Charge Sheet no.154 of 2020 in connection with Bistupur P.S. Case no.88 of 2020, keeping the investigation of the said case open for collection of some more evidences, which are likely to surface. So far as Bistupur P.S. Case no.87 of 2020 is concerned, the investigation is still continuing and5several persons have been arrested on the basis of the evidences collected so far. 
 7. Learned counsel for the respondents also submits that on 26th April, 2020, a team of excise authorities conducted physical verification of the stock available in the licensed bar of Hotel Alcor and found deficient stock of liquor and increased consumption during the period of lockdown despite sealing of the bar with effect from 24th March, 2020. The said fact strongly indicates that the petitioner-Company was actively involved in defiance of the orders of different government agencies during lockdown period and certainly not for basic necessities of the kind mentioned in the direction of Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India/NDMA as exception, rather it was involved in commission of offence relating to moral turpitude. It is further submitted that the respondent no.1 issued show cause notice vide memo no.445/Excise dated 13th May, 2020 to the licence holder i.e. Rajiv Singh Dugal, who is one of the Directors of the petitioner- Company, as to why the petitioner-Company should not be blacklisted under the provisions of the Bihar (now Jharkhand) Excise Act, 1915. Learned counsel for the respondents also submits that the petitioner neither sought any permission from the district/ appropriate authorities nor any intimation was given with regard to the fact that few persons were stranded in the said hotel due to imposition of complete lockdown. The respondent authorities have exercised their discretionary power conferred underSections 30and34of the Act, 2005 to seal the hotel premises as well as have acted on the request of the Investigating Officer to preserve and collect evidences relating to criminal offences. It is also submitted that the petitioner could not have been allowed to remove or tamper with all the evidences from the place of occurrence relating to the offences of serious nature, which were deliberately committed during lockdown period. Hence, the petitioner was issued show cause notice for sealing the hotel premises. 
 8. Learned counsel for the respondents further submits that the report of the Special Officer, Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee, Jamshedpur, as contained in letter no.812 dated 26th April, 2020, clearly mentions that the Accommodation Manager of Hotel Alcor, namely, Pawan Deep was present at the time of sealing of the premises and an inventory was prepared in his presence. On his request, the electric connection6in the cold storage situated in the basement of the hotel and staff quarters of 70 employees as well as in the parking area was not disconnected and the security guards as well as the maintenance staff were allowed to remain in the premises for security purpose. Moreover, the magistrate and police force have also been posted there for better security. Learned counsel for the respondents further submits that the investigation of the criminal cases is still going on and on the request of the Superintendent of Policy (City), Jamshedpur, the seal of the hotel was opened on 21st June, 2020 for collection of some more evidence and it was re-sealed thereafter. The hotel premises of the petitioner is huge and as such certain evidences may come out in course of further investigation. Rajiv Singh Dugal is one of the Directors of all the companies whose offices are situated in the premises of the Hotel Alcor, who is accused in the criminal case, particularly instituted for using the said hotel for prostitution. It is settled position of law that one who seeks equity must do equity. No one is entitled to the aid of the Court of equity when that aid has become necessary through his/her own fault. Equity does not relieve a person of the consequences of his/her carelessness. It is lastly submitted that the respondents have acted in good faith in exercise of the power conferred under the provisions of the Act, 2005. The lockdown is still in force and as such the petitioner has not suffered any loss or injury by sealing of the said hotel premises. 
 9. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the materials available on record. Learned counsel for the petitioner in course of argument has confined the prayer made in the writ petition to the extent of opening of sealing of the premises in question and hence this court is not entering into the details of the allegations levelled against it for violation of the provisions of various Acts. The only question falls for consideration before this Court is as to whether the action of the respondents in sealing the said premises is in accordance with law. 
 10. The thrust of the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that even if it is assumed that there were some violations of lockdown guidelines, there is no provision for sealing the premises either under the Act, 2005 or underthe Codeof Criminal Procedure. Moreover, the power undersections 30and34of the Act, 2005 has been conferred to the district authority to act as the district planning, coordinating and7implementing body for disaster management. The Senior Incident Commander-cum-Sub Divisional Magistrate was neither empowered nor authorized by the district authority to seal any property for alleged violation of the lockdown guidelines. Learned counsel for the petitioner has also submitted that the accused persons have already been granted bail by a Bench of this Court in connection with the criminal cases, however, the said premises is still under seal of the district administration in the garb of collecting evidence, which is causing irreparable loss and injury to the petitioner. 
 11. Learned counsel for the respondents has contended that the seal of the said premises was quite necessary, considering the nature of offences committed in Hotel Alcor. It has also been submitted that the power of sealing of any immovable property for collecting evidence and to stop the offender from tampering the evidences available at the crime scene is inherently provided inthe Codeof Criminal Procedure. Moreover, though there is no direct power of sealing under the Act, 2005, the same can be said to be residuary/incidental power which has to be exercised for effective management and to prevent further violation of the guidelines issued under the said Act. Hence, the action taken by the respondents in sealing the said premises is not illegal and arbitrary either under the Act, 2005 or underthe Codeof Criminal Procedure. 
 12. To appreciate the rival submissions of learned counsel for the parties, it would be relevant to refer the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court rendered in the case of Nevada Properties Private Limited through its Directors vs. state of Maharashtra & Anr., reported in 2019 SCC Online SC 1247. The relevant paragraphs of the said judgment are quoted as under:- 
 Immovable property cannot, in its strict sense, be seized, though documents of title, etc. relating to immovable property can be seized, taken into custody and produced. Immovable property can be attached and also locked/sealed. It could be argued that the word 'seize' would include such action of attachment and sealing. Seizure of immovable property in this sense and manner would in law require dispossession of the person in occupation/possession of the immovable property, unless there are no claimants, which would be rare. Language ofSection 102of the Code does not support the interpretation that the police officer has the power to dispossess a person in occupation and take possession of an immovable property in order to seize it. In the absence of the Legislature conferring this express or implied power underSection 102of the Code to8the police officer, we would hesitate and not hold that this power should be inferred and is implicit in the power to effect seizure. Equally important, for the purpose of interpretation is the scope and object ofSection 102of the Code, which is to help and assist investigation and to enable the police officer to collect and collate evidence to be produced to prove the charge complained of and set up in the charge sheet. The Section is a part of the provisions concerning investigation undertaken by the police officer. After the charge sheet is filed, the prosecution leads and produces evidence to secure conviction.Section 102is not, per se, an enabling provision by which the police officer acts to seize the property to do justice and to hand over the property to a person whom the police officer feels is the rightful and true owner. This is clear from the objective behindSection 102, use of the words in the Section and the scope and ambit of the power conferred on the Criminal Court videSections 451to459of the Code. The expression 'circumstances which create suspicion of the commission of any offence' inSection 102does not refer to a firm opinion or an adjudication/finding by a police officer to ascertain whether or not 'any property' is required to be seized. The word 'suspicion' is a weaker and a broader expression than 'reasonable belief' or 'satisfaction'. The police officer is an investigator and not an adjudicator or a decision maker. This is the reason why the Ordinance was enacted to deal with attachment of money and immovable properties in cases of scheduled offences. In case and if we allow the police officer to 'seize' immovable property on a mere 'suspicion of the commission of any offence', it would mean and imply giving a drastic and extreme power to dispossess etc. to the police officer on a mere conjecture and surmise, that is, on suspicion, which has hitherto not been exercised. We have hardly come across any case where immovable property was seized vide an attachment order that was treated as a seizure order by police officer underSection 102of the Code. The reason is obvious. Disputes relating to title, possession, etc., of immovable property are civil disputes which have to be decided and adjudicated in Civil Courts. We must discourage and stall any attempt to convert civil disputes into criminal cases to put pressure on the other side (See Binod Kumar v. State of Bihar(2014)10SCC663). Thus, it will not be proper to hold thatSection 102of the Code empowers a police officer to seize immovable property, land, plots, residential houses, streets or similar properties. Given the nature of criminal litigation, such seizure of an immovable property by the police officer in the form of an attachment and dispossession would not facilitate investigation to collect evidence/material to be produced during inquiry and trial. As far as possession of the immovable property is concerned, specific provisions in the form ofSections 145and146of the Code can be invoked as per and in accordance with law.Section 102of the Code is not a general provision which enables and authorises the police officer to seize immovable property for being able to be produced in the Criminal Court during trial. This, however, would not bar or prohibit the police officer from seizing documents/papers of title relating to immovable property, as it is distinct and different from seizure of immovable property. Disputes and matters relating to the physical and legal possession and title of the property must be adjudicated upon by a Civil Court. 
 21. In view of the aforesaid discussion, the Reference is answered by holding that the power of a police officer underSection 102of the Code to seize any property, which may be found under circumstances that create suspicion of the9commission of any offence, would not include the power to attach, seize and seal an immovable property."" 
 13. The Hon'ble Supreme court in the aforesaid judgment has held thatSection 102Cr.P.C. postulates seizure of the property. However, an immovable property cannot, in its direct sense, be seized, though documents of title etc. relating to immovable properties can be seized, taken into custody and produced. Language of Section 102 Cr.P.C. does not support the interpretation that the police officer has the power to dispossess a person who is in occupation, to take possession of an immovable property in order to seize it. 
 14. Further in the case ofHari Krishna Mandir Trust vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors., reported in 2020 SCC Online SC 631, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the right to property may not be a fundamental right any longer, but the same is still a constitutional right underArticle 300Aand it is also a human right and, therefore, no person can be deprived of his property except by the authority of law. The High Court exercising its jurisdiction underArticle 226of the Constitution of India does not only have the power to issue writ of mandamus, rather is duty bound to exercise such power where the government or a public authority has failed to exercise or has wrongly exercised discretion conferred upon it by a statute, or a rule, or a policy decision or has exercised such discretion with mala fide or on irrelevant consideration. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in paragraph no.103 of the said judgment has held as under:- 
 ""103. The Court is duty bound to issue a writ of Mandamus for enforcement of a public duty. There can be no doubt that an important requisite for issue of Mandamus is that Mandamus lies to enforce a legal duty. This duty must be shown to exist towards the applicant. A statutory duty must exist before it can be enforced through Mandamus. Unless a statutory duty or right can be read in the provision, Mandamus cannot be issued to enforce the same."" 
 15. In the case ofM. C. Mehta vs. Union of India & Ors., reported in 2020 SCC Online SC 648, as has been relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under:- 
 ""106. The power of sealing of property carries civil consequences. A person can be deprived of the property by following a procedure in accordance with law. The Monitoring Committee is not authorized to take action concerning the residential premises situated on the private land. If there is unauthorized construction or in case of deviation, the requisite10provisions are under the DMC Act, such assections 343,345,347(A),347(B). The mode of action and adjudication under the Act is provided including appellate provisions and that of the Tribunal. It would not be appropriate to the Monitoring Committee to usurp statutory powers and act beyond authority conferred upon it by the Court. The Monitoring Committee could not have sealed the residential premises, which were not misused for the commercial purpose as done vide Report No. 149, nor it could have directed the demolition of those residential properties. 
 107.Article 300Aof the Constitution provides that nobody can be deprived of the property and right of residence otherwise in the manner prescribed by law. When the statute prescribes a mode, the property's deprivation cannot be done in other modes since this Court did not authorize the Committee to take action in the matter. An action could have been taken in no other manner except in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law as laid down in the decisions referred to at the Bar thus: 
 (a)State of Rajasthan v. Basant Nahata, (2005) 12 SCC 77, wherein this Court observed: 
 ""59. ....In absence of any substantive provisions contained in a parliamentary or legislative act, he cannot be refrained from dealing with his property in any manner he likes. Such statutory interdict would be opposed to one's right of property as envisaged underArticle 300-Aof the Constitution."" 
 (b)K.T. Plantation Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Karnataka, (2011) 9 SCC 1 in which it was opined: ""168.Article 300-Aproclaims that no person can be deprived of his property save by authority of law, meaning thereby that a person cannot be deprived of his property merely by an executive fiat, without any specific legal authority or without the support of law made by a competent legislature. The expression ""property"" inArticle 300-Aconfined not to land alone, it includes intangibles like copyrights and other intellectual property and embraces every possible interest recognised by law. 
 169. This Court inState of W.B. v. Vishnunarayan and Associates (P) Ltd. [(2002) 4 SCC 134], while examining the provisions of the West Bengal Great Eastern Hotel (Acquisition of Undertaking) Act, 1980, held in the context ofArticle 300-Athat the State or executive officers cannot interfere with the right of others unless they can point out the specific provisions of law which authorises their rights."" 
 (emphasis supplied) 
 (c)In T. Vijayalakshmi v. Town Planning Member, (2006) 8 SCC 502, the Court observed: 
 ""13. Town Planning legislations are regulatory in nature. The right to property of a person would include a right to construct a building. Such a right, however, can be restricted by reason of a legislation. In terms of the provisions of the Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act, a comprehensive development plan was prepared. It indisputably is still in force. Whether the amendments to the said comprehensive development plan as proposed by the Authority would ultimately be accepted by the State or not is uncertain. It is yet to11apply its mind. Amendments to a development plan must conform to the provisions of the Act. As noticed hereinbefore, the State has called for objection from the citizens. Ecological balance no doubt is required to be maintained and the courts while interpreting a statute should bestow serious consideration in this behalf, but ecological aspects, it is trite, are ordinarily a part of the town planning legislation. If in the legislation itself or in the statute governing the field, ecological aspects have not been taken into consideration keeping in view the future need, the State and the Authority must take the blame therefor. We must assume that these aspects of the matter were taken into consideration by the Authority and the State. But the rights of the parties cannot be intermeddled with so long as an appropriate amendment in the legislation is not brought into force. 
 *** 
 15. The law in this behalf is explicit. Right of a person to construct residential houses in the residential area is a valuable right. The said right can only be regulated in terms of a regulatory statute but unless there exists a clear provision the same cannot be taken away. ...."" 
 (emphasis supplied) 
 (d) In the matter ofState of U.P. v. Manohar, (2005) 2 SCC 126, this Court observed: 
 ""7. Ours is a constitutional democracy and the rights available to the citizens are declared by the Constitution. AlthoughArticle 19(1)(f)was deleted by the Forty-fourth Amendment to the Constitution,Article 300-Ahas been placed in the Constitution, which reads as follows: 
 ""300-A. Persons not to be deprived of property save by authority of law.--No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law."" 
 8. This is a case where we find utter lack of legal authority for deprivation of the respondent's property by the appellants who are State authorities. ..."" 
 (e)In Delhi Airtech Services (P) Ltd. v. State of U.P., (2011) 9 SCC 354, this Court held: 
 ""83. The expression ""law"" which figures both inArticle 21andArticle 300-Amust be given the same meaning. In both the cases the law would mean a validly enacted law. In order to be valid law it must be just, fair and reasonable having regard to the requirement of Articles 14 and 21 as explained in Maneka Gandhi. This is especially so, as ""law"" in both the Articles 21 and 300-A is meant to prevent deprivation of rights. Insofar asArticle 21is concerned, it is a fundamental right whereas inArticle 300-Ait is a constitutional right which has been given a status of a basic human right."" 
 (f) It was further argued that planning laws are expropritory and should be strictly construed, and any ambiguity is to be construed in favour of the property owner as laid down inDelhi Airtech Services (P) Ltd. v. State of U.P. (supra) thus: 
 ""129. Statutes which encroach upon rights, whether as regards person or property, are subject to strict12construction in the same way as penal Acts. It is a recognised rule that they should be interpreted, if possible, so as to respect such rights and if there is any ambiguity, the construction which is in favour of the freedom of the individual should be adopted. (See Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Edn. by P. St. J. Langan.) 
 130. This Court in Devinder Singh7 held that theLand Acquisition Actis an expropritory legislation and followed the case ofHindustan Petroleum Corpn. v. Darius Shapur Chenai[(2005) 7 SCC 627]. Therefore, it should be construed strictly. The Court has also taken the view that even in cases of directory requirements, substantial compliance with such provision would be necessary."" 
 (emphasis supplied) 
 (g)In Ramchandra Ravindra Waghmare v. Indore Municipal Corporation, (2017) 1 SCC 667, it was opined: 
 ""67. It was also submitted that town planning and municipal institutes are regulating and restricting the use of private property under the aforesaid Acts. They are ""expropritory legislation"". Thus they are liable to be construed strictly as laid down inIndore Vikas Pradhikaran v. Pure Industrial Coke & Chemicals Ltd. [(2007) 8 SCC 705]"" 
 (h)In Chairman, Indore Vikas Pradhikaran v. Pure Industrial Coke & Chemicals Ltd., (2007) 8 SCC 705, it was held: 
 ""57.The Actbeing regulatory in nature as by reason thereof the right of an owner of property to use and develop stands restricted, requires strict construction. An owner of land ordinarily would be entitled to use or develop the same for any purpose unless there exists certain regulation in a statute or statutory rules. Regulations contained in such statute must be interpreted in such a manner so as to least interfere with the right to property of the owner of such land. Restrictions are made in larger public interest. Such restrictions, indisputably must be reasonable ones. (See Balram Kumawat v. Union of India[(2003) 7 SCC 628];Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti v. Pilibhit Pantnagar Beej Ltd[(2004) 1 SCC 391] andUnion of India v. West Coast Paper Mills Ltd.[(2004) 2 SCC 747] The statutory scheme contemplates that a person and owner of land should not ordinarily be deprived from the user thereof by way of reservation or designation. 
 58. Exproprietory legislation, as is well-known, must be given a strict construction."" 
 (i)In State of Gujarat v. Shantilal Mangaldas, (1969) 1 SCC 509, it was held: 
 ""55. ...... Once the draft town-planning scheme is sanctioned, the land becomes subject to the provisions of the Town Planning Act, and on the final town- 
 planning scheme being sanctioned, by statutory operation the title of the various owners is readjusted and the lands needed for a public purpose vest in the local authority. Land required for any of the purposes of a town planning scheme cannot be acquired13otherwise than under the Act, for it is a settled rule of interpretation of statutes that when power is given under a statute to do a certain thing in a certain way the thing must be done in that way or not at all:"" 
 (emphasis supplied) 
 (j)In Bhavnagar University v. Palitana Sugar Mill (P) Ltd., (2003) 2 SCC 111, it was opined: 
 ""40. The statutory interdict of use and enjoyment of the property must be strictly construed. It is well settled that when a statutory authority is required to do a thing in a particular manner, the same must be done in that manner or not at all. The State and other authorities while acting under the said Act are only creature of statute. They must act within the four corners thereof."" 
 (emphasis supplied) 
 (k)In Shrirampur Municipal Council v. Satyabhamabai Bhimaji Dawkher, (2013) 5 SCC 627 it was held: 
 ""43. ...... This is the reason why time-limit of ten years has been prescribed inSection 31(5)and also underSections 126and127of the 1966 Act for the acquisition of land, with a stipulation that if the land is not acquired within six months of the service of notice underSection 127or steps are not commenced for acquisition, reservation of the land will be deemed to have lapsed. Shri Naphade's interpretation of the scheme ofSections 126and127, if accepted, will lead to absurd results and the landowners will be deprived of their right to use the property for an indefinite period without being paid compensation. That would tantamount to depriving the citizens of their property without the sanction of law and would result in violation ofArticle 300-Aof the Constitution."" 
 (emphasis supplied)."" 
 16. It is, thus, well settled that the power of sealing of property carries civil consequences. A person can be deprived of the property only by following due procedure in accordance with law. No person shall be deprived of the right of property, except by the procedure prescribed under law. 
 17. In view of the aforesaid factual and legal position, I am of the considered view that the sealing of the said premises by the order of the respondent no.2 is not in accordance with the provisionsof the Codeof Criminal Procedure. So far as the provisions ofSections 30and34of the Act, 2005, which have been referred by the learned counsel for the respondents to justify the order of sealing of the said premises, are concerned, no such power of sealing of any premise/building has been conferred to the Senior Incident Commander-cum-Sub Divisional Magistrate. Moreover, the order of sealing also does not appear to be reasonable and proportionate, as the same has been done for an indefinite period. Even if the alleged crime scene is to be protected to14ensure that the evidence of alleged offence does not disappear, the concerned authority after locking and sealing the crime scene does not require much time to reopen the same and to prepare an inventory. Nonetheless, the authorities cannot be allowed to keep the premises locked for unreasonably long period than what is absolutely necessary. By doing so, the authorities definitely violate the right of the owner or occupier of the premises being without any legal sanctity. Even if it is assumed that there are evidences relating to the alleged offence in the premises of the said hotel, the same cannot empower the respondents to continue with the sealing for an indefinite period. The purpose of sealing must be to collect evidences within a reasonable time. In case, some of the evidences were of such nature which could not have been removed from the said premises, the requirement was to prepare a record of seizure of those articles pending trial of the case. Undisputedly, there are several offices of different companies/firms in the hotel premises, which have no bearing with the allegations levelled in both the first information reports irrespective of the fact that one of the directors of the said companies/firms, namely, Rajiv Singh Dugal is also involved in commission of the alleged offence and, therefore, the respondent no.2 was otherwise not empowered to seal the entire premises particularly the offices of different companies/firms. The Court cannot be unmindful of the fact that due to sealing of the entire premises, several employees have gone unemployed and are facing financial difficulties. 
 18. One of the arguments of learned counsel for the respondents is that a proceeding under the Bihar (now Jharkhand) Excise Act, 1915 has also been initiated, as after verification of the bar situated in the Hotel Alcor, the liquor stock was found deficient which prima facie indicated the increase of consumption of liquor during the lockdown period. Learned counsel for the respondents has, however, failed to show any such provision under the Bihar (now Jharkhand) Excise Act, 1915 which empowers the excise authorities to seal rest of the premises except which has been shown as the bar premises. It may thus be concluded that the sealing cannot be held to be justified in absence of any express power under the statute conferred to any authority. 
 19. It also appears that the persons, who have been made accused in the criminal case, are now enjoying the privilege of bail, however, the15premises of the concerned hotel is still under lock and seal. Though it has been stated in the counter affidavit that the matter is still under investigation, yet it certainly appears that the investigation has continued for fairly long period considering the nature of offence alleged in the first information reports. 
 20. Under the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the respondent no.2 is directed to remove the seal of the entire hotel premises including the offices of the companies/firms after preparing an inventory of articles, if so required, in connection with the pending criminal cases, which are lying there, and while doing so, the video recording of the same shall be done in presence of the representative of the petitioner. If any document/file/electronic device is required as evidence, the Investigating Officer is at liberty to recover the same. All such exercises must be concluded till 14th September, 2020. The seal of the entire hotel premises shall be opened on 15th September, 2020 at 10:00 a.m. 
 21. It is, however, observed that even after opening of the premises, the petitioner shall comply the lockdown guidelines being issued by the competent authority from time to time. 
 22. The writ petition is, accordingly, disposed of with the aforesaid observations and directions.

 CORAM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJESH SHANKAR 
 ----- 
 1. This case is taken up through video conferencing. 
 2. The present writ petition has been preferred for quashing the notice dated 03.09.2020 (Annexure-3 to the writ petition) issued by the National Law School of India University, Bengaluru, declaring that a separate examination for admission to its Five Years B.A, LL.B. (Hons.) degree programme will be held on 12.09.2020. 
 3. The factual background of the case as stated in the writ petition is that the in the year 1987 the first National Law University namely, the National Law School of India University was established in Bengaluru, Karnataka (hereinafter referred as 'NLSIU, Bengaluru')- respondent no.1 in furtherance of second-generation reforms of legal education. Thereafter, a number of National Law Universities have been established in different States with the primary objective of providing highest standards of legal education and to make Indian legal education comparable with the most reputed international institutions of legal education. Till date 23 NLUs have been established in various states of India. A PIL being CWP No. 68 of 2006 was filed in the2Supreme Court of India in the year 2006 seeking test for admission to all the NLUs and thereafter in the year 2008 seven National Law Universities signed a Memorandum of Understanding to hold Common Law Admission Test (CLAT). The first CLAT examination was conducted in the year 2008. Subsequently in 2015, a revised Memorandum of Understanding was signed by NLUs to include other seven National Law Universities within the ambit of the CLAT. In the meanwhile, a PIL was filed seeking establishment of a permanent secretariat with a permanent body to look into the conduct of CLAT and the Supreme Court of India directed the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India to ensure that CLAT is conducted in a just and fair manner. Thereafter, on 17.10.2018 a permanent CLAT Secretariat was established at Bengaluru and it was decided that CLAT would be conducted by the Executive Committee of CLAT consortium. Thereafter, on 26.03.2019 the CLAT consortium was registered at Bengaluru under the Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act wherein 16 NLUs signed as founding members and consequently the CLAT Consortium became a legal entity. Subsequently, all the remaining NLUs except National Law University, Delhi joined CLAT consortium which has three permanent members namely National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru; National Academy of Legal Studies and Research, Hyderabad; National Law Institute University, Bhopal and the Vice Chancellor of NLISU, Bengaluru is the Ex-officio Secretary of the CLAT consortium. In January, 2020, CLAT consortium opened registration for CLAT Examination 2020 fixing 31.03.2020 as initial deadline for registration which was subsequently extended to 10.07.2020. The petitioners submitted the registration forms within the prescribed period. However, due to the outbreak of Corona virus (Covid-19) Pandemic, the CLAT 2020 was not conducted on the scheduled date and was shifted from time to time and presently the said examination is scheduled to be held on 28.09.2020. In the meantime, on 03.09.2020 the NLSIU, Bengaluru came up with a notice informing inter alia that the NLSIU Bengaluru would be conducting a separate examination on 12.09.2020 for admission to its five years B.A. LL.B. (Hons) degree programme. Hence, the present writ petition. 
 4. Mr. Shubham Gautam, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners submits that the act of NLSIU Bengaluru in declaring a3separate examination for admission to its Five Years B.A. LL.B. (Hons) degree programme for the session 2020-21 is illegal and arbitrary, as the same has been issued in violation of Clause 15.7 of the Bye Laws of the Consortium of National Law Universities. It is submitted that the Vice Chancellor of the NALSAR, Hyderabad has expressed his dismay that while NLSIU, Bengaluru chooses to continue in the consortium, yet conducts its own admission test which is not permissible under the Bye Laws of the consortium. It is also submitted that by the arbitrary action of the NLSIU Bengaluru, the right of the petitioners to have an examination in just and fair manner has been violated. Moreover, the action of NLSIU, Bengaluru is violative of the principle of promissory estoppel, since it has withdrawn from CLAT, 2020 after submission of the registration forms by the students intending to appear for CLAT. The declaration of new date of examination by NLSIU, Bengaluru, about 10 days before the declared date of examination is illegal, arbitrary and whimsical. It is also submitted that the action of the NLSIU, Bengaluru is against the direction of the Hon'ble Supreme Court to get the examination conducted in fair and just manner. 
 5. Mr. Manoj Tandon, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 4, submits that this court is empowered to exercise its writ jurisdiction, keeping in view the mandate ofArticle 226(2)of the Constitution of India. 
 6. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Union of India- 
 Respondent No.2 informs the court that a writ petition being W.P.(C) No.1030 of 2020 raising similar issue has been filed in the Supreme Court and another writ petition is also pending in the High Court of Madhya Pradesh. 
 7. Mr. Sajan Poovayya, the learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of NLSIU Bengaluru submits that since the writ petitions with similar grievance have been filed in the Supreme Court as well as in the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, it would not be appropriate for this Court to entertain the present matter in view of the principle of forum non- convenience. The learned Senior Counsel, while justifying the impugned notice dated 03.09.2020, submits that since the examination of CLAT 2020 has repeatedly been postponed due to the outbreak of Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, NLSIU Bengaluru has been put to a uniquely disadvantageous position as it follows a ""trimester system"" 
 and if the admission is not completed before the end of September 2020, it will inevitably result in a Zero year with no admission. It is also submitted that under the said circumstance the NLSIU Bengaluru has been compelled to conduct a separate admission process for the said examination for the academic year 2020-21. It is further submitted that before issuing notice dated 03.09.2020, the matter was considered at length in the Faculty Meeting of the University and only when it was found that CLAT 2020 has been postponed from 7th to 28th September 2020, the faculty unanimously decided to conduct a common entrance online test at the earliest and with the lowest possible application fee. It is also submitted that NLSIU Bengaluru is committed to ensure that NLAT 2020 must be conducted in an accessible and student friendly manner at various centres across India managed by M/s Testpan Pvt. Ltd., a national centre based testing company providing equipment and space for those students who are unable to meet NLAT 2020 test requirements. It is further submitted that more than 30,000 students have already registered for NLAT 2020 and only handful of students are raising grievances which would indicate that the decision of the respondent no.1 is in interest of the students at large. 
 8. Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the materials available on record. The petitioners are residing within the territory of the State of Jharkhand from where they have registered themselves for CLAT 2020 to be conducted by the CLAT consortium. They feel aggrieved with the notice dated 03.09.2020 inviting applications for admission to the five-year integrated B.A. LL.B. (Hons) programme dated 03.09.2020 whereby it was resolved by NLSIU, Bengaluru that separate examination process for B.A, LL.B. would be conducted for the academic session 2020-21. 
 9. The examination of National Law Aptitude Test (NLAT) 2020 is scheduled to be held tomorrow i.e. on 12.09.2020 and the students from all over the country will appear in the said examination and thus the primary question before this court is as to whether in the present facts and situation, would it be appropriate for this court, keeping in view the future prospects of thousands of students, to pass any direction which may have ramifications all over the country. 
 10. In the case ofNarendra Kumar Maheshwari v. Union of India & Others, reported in 1990 Supp SCC 440, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under: 
 ""113. Before we conclude, we must note that good deal of argument was adduced that these applications in different High Courts in civil suits were not genuine and properly motivated, but were mala fide. Even though these might not have been to feed fat an innocent object, it was apparent that it was to feed fat a grudge in respect of a competitive project by a competitor. Anyway, in the view we have taken, it is not necessary to decide the bona fides or mala fides of the applicants. Shri Nariman, when he moved the application initially, had suggested that we should lay down certain norms as to how the courts in different parts of the country should grant injunction or entertain applications affecting an all-India issue or having ramifications all over the country. Except that before the courts grant any injunction, they should have regard to the principles of comity of courts in a federal structure and have regard to self-restraint and circumspection, we do not at this stage lay down any more definite norms. We may also perhaps add that it may be impossible to lay down hard and fast rules of general application because of the diverse situations which give rise to problems of this nature. Each case has its own special facts and complications and it will be a disadvantage, rather than an advantage, to attempt and apply any stereotyped formula to all cases. Perhaps in this sphere, the High Courts themselves might be able to introduce a certain amount of discipline having regard to the principles of comity of courts administering the same general laws applicable all over the country in respect of granting interim orders which will have repercussion or effect beyond the jurisdiction of the particular courts. Such an exercise will be useful contribution in evolving good conventions in the federal judicial system."" 
 11. In the case of Chhavi Mehrotra Vs. Director General, Health Services, reported in 1995 Supp (3) SCC 434, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under: - 
 ""1. ----- It is a clear case where the High Court ought not to have exercised jurisdiction underArticle 226where the matter was clearly seized of by this Court in a petition under Article 
 32. The petitioner was eonomine a party to the proceedings before this Court. It is an unhappy situation that the learned Judge of the High Court permitted himself to issue certain directions which, if implemented, would detract from the plenitude of the orders of this Court. The learned Single Judge's perception of justice of the matter might have been different and the abstinence that the observance of judicial propriety, counsels might be unsatisfactory; but judicial discipline would require that in a hierarchical system it is imperative that such conflicting exercise of jurisdiction should strictly be avoided. We restrain ourselves from saying anything more."" 
 12. In a recent judgement, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of India & Ors. Vs. R. Thiyagarajan, reported in 2020 SCC Online SC 349, has held as under: - 
 ""18. We also are of the view that the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction in matters like this. The High Court exercise its jurisdiction only over State(s) of which it is the High Court. It has no jurisdiction for the rest of the country. Matters like the present may be pending in various parts of the country. In the present case, matter had been decided by the Delhi High Court but some other High Court may or may not have taken different view. The High Court of Madras could not have passed such order. It has virtually usurped the jurisdiction of other High Courts in the country. It is true that sometimes this Court has ordered that all similarly situated employees may be granted similar relief but the High Court does not have the benefit of exercising the power underArticle 142of the Constitution. In any event, this Court exercises jurisdiction over the entire country whereas the jurisdiction of the High Court is limited to the territorial jurisdiction of the State(s) of which it is the High Court. The High Court may be justified in passing such an order when it only affects the employees of the State falling within its jurisdiction but, in our opinion, it could not have passed such an order in the case of employees where pan India repercussions would be involved."" 
 13. It may thus be construed that there cannot be a straitjacket formula to deal with the cases affecting an all-India issue or having ramifications all over the country. The High Courts themselves should introduce a certain amount of discipline having regard to the principles of comity of courts administering the same general laws applicable all over the country in respect of granting interim orders which will have repercussion or effect beyond the jurisdiction of the particular courts. Such an exercise will be useful contribution in evolving good conventions in the federal judicial system. It is not justified for a High Court to pass any order which has pan India repercussions. The reason behind it is that when the same issue is raised in different High Courts, there might be a possibility of different views coming up which would create an impossible situation for the implementing agency to comply all the orders. 
 14. The learned counsel for the petitioners has tried to convince this Court that in view ofArticle 226(2)of the Constitution of India, the power conferred to the High Courts by virtue of clause (1) to issue directions, orders or writs to any government, authority or person, may also be exercised by any High Court in relation to the territories within which the cause of action, wholly or in part arises, notwithstanding that the seat of such government or authority or the residence of such person7is not within those territories. Since the petitioners have filled up the forms from the State of Jharkhand and are residing within its territory, this court has the territorial jurisdiction to hear the matter and to pass appropriate direction on the respondents. 
 15. In the case of Kusum Ingots & Alloys Ltd. Vs. Union of India & Another, reported in (2004) 6 SCC 254, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that even if a small part of cause of action arises within the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court, the same by itself may not be considered to be a determinative factor compelling the High Court to decide the matter on merit. The Court, in appropriate cases, may refuse to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction by invoking the doctrine of forum convenience. 
 16. In the present case, most of the grounds taken by the petitioners in challenging the impugned notice dated 03.09.2020 issued by NLSIU, Bengaluru to conduct NLAT, 2020 are substantially based on the terms and conditions of the byelaws agreed amongst all the participating NLUs forming the CLAT Consortium, the secretariat of which is located at Bengaluru itself. The petitioners-students have also based their contentions on the alleged violation of different terms and conditions of the byelaws by NLSIU Bengaluru which is also located in the State of Karnataka. In my view, it primarily seems to be an inter se dispute between CLAT consortium and NLSIU Bengaluru and this court has no territorial jurisdiction to adjudicate the same. 
 17. Moreover, it has been brought to the notice of this Court that a writ petition has also been filed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court by a former Vice-Chancellor of NLSIU, Bengaluru, challenging the decision of NLSIU, Bengaluru to conduct a separate Law Entrance Examination i.e. NLAT, 2020, which is still pending. 
 18. Otherwise also, on the query of this court put to the learned counsel for petitioners, particularly on the point as to what prejudice has been caused to the petitioners by the action of the respondent no.1 in conducting NLAT, 2020, it has been submitted that one of the technical requirements to appear in the said examination by maintaining the minimum bandwidth speed of 1 MBPS is arbitrary and unreasonable. In response to that, it has been submitted by the learned Senior Counsel for the respondent no.1 that NLSIU, Bengaluru has now reduced required internet bandwidth to 512 kbps which can easily be8accessed by any of the candidates. The learned counsel for the petitioners has also contended that no test centre has been provided in the State of Jharkhand, however, the said contention has been refuted by Mr. Poovayya, submitting that a centre has already been provided in Dhanbad. The learned counsel for the petitioners has also contended that the pattern of the examination has been changed by the respondent no.1, which may cause prejudice to the interest of the petitioners. Refuting the said contention, Mr. Poovayya has submitted that the pattern of the examination has not been changed, rather the number of questions has been reduced and the purpose behind it is not to test the students strictly on the aptitude of the law but on general aptitude. The learned counsel for the petitioners has further argued that on one hand the students has been given option to appear at test centres across India and on the other hand, it has been provided in the notification that the respondent no.1 will not be responsible for technical faults, internet connection etc., which is, in fact, an arbitrary and unreasonable decision. 
 19. The learned counsel for the petitioners has put reliance on para 15 of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, rendered in the case of Disha Panchal & Others Vs. Union of India, through the Secretary & Others, reported in (2018) 17 SCC 278. It was alleged in the said case that the petitioners faced difficulties in appearing CLAT examination due to mismanagement of the authorities conducting the examination. Their Lordships found substance in the claim of the petitioners and held as under: - 
 ""15. We have dealt with the matter only from the standpoint of how best to compensate the candidates who lost valuable time while undergoing test. We must record that we are not at all satisfied with the way the examination was conducted. The body which was given the task of conducting the examination was duty-bound to ensure facilities of uninterrupted UPS and generator facility. The record indicates complete inadequacy on that point. We therefore direct the Union of India in the Ministry of Human Resources and Development to appoint a committee to look into the matter and take appropriate remedial measures including penal action, if any, against the body which was entrusted with the task. The committee so constituted shall also look into the aspect of having completely satisfactory arrangements in future so that no such instances are repeated or reoccur in coming years. We must also observe that the idea of entrusting the task of monitoring the conduct of entire examination to different Law Universities every year also needs to be revisited. The agreement with the examination conducting body, which was placed on record indicates that as against the amount made over to such examination conducting body, the fees charged from the9candidates is far in excess. The committee shall bestow consideration to all these aspects after having inputs from such sources as it may deem appropriate including the Bar Council of India and make a detailed report to this Court within three months from today."" 
 20. The facts and circumstance of the present case is entirely different. In the present case, the examination is yet to be conducted. This Court is of the view that such a hypothetical argument cannot be taken into consideration at this stage. 
 21. In view of the aforesaid factual and legal position, I am of the considered view that since the present matter has pan India ramifications and petitioners have failed to make out a strong ground so as to invoke the extraordinary writ jurisdiction of this Court which is otherwise plenary in nature, it would not be appropriate for this Court to interfere with the notice dated 03.09.2020 issued by NLSIU, Bengaluru. 
 22. The writ petition is, accordingly, dismissed (Rajesh Shankar, J.) Sanjay/AFR"

 CORAM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ANIL KUMAR CHOUDHARY 
 ------ 
 Heard the parties through video conferencing. Apprehending his arrest in connection with Piparwar P.S. Case No. 36 of 2019 instituted underSections 385,386,387,120(B) of the Indian Penal Code andSections 17(i)(ii) of the C.L.A. Act and Sections 16, 17, 20, 23 of the U.A.P., Act, the petitioner has moved this Court for grant of privileges of anticipatory bail. 
 Mr. Alok Anand- learned counsel for the petitioner undertakes to remove the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter within two weeks after the lockdown is over. 
 In view of personal undertaking given by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter are ignored for the present. 
 Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that earlier the prayer for anticipatory bail of the petitioner was withdrawn but the fresh ground is that the co-accused persons have been granted the privileges of anticipatory bail. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that under protection of the Supremo of TPC extremist organization namely Barjesh Ganjhu @ Gopal Singh Bhokta and Akaraman Jee @ Ravindra and Bhikhan Ganjhu, the ""Displaced Villagers Solitary Management Committee"" has been organized and levy has been collected from the coal traders and D.O. holders and others associated with Piparwar Coal Project, Ashoka Project Kanta, Kalyanpur Kanta and Purnadih Coal Project by putting the victims in fear of the TPC Extremist Organization and major part of the levy money has been given to the TPC extremist organization which has been used in criminal activity and works against the law. It is next submitted that the police party who were the members of Task Force raided the house of Naresh Ganjhu and from his house several pass- books of different banks in the name of Naresh Ganjhu, his family members, cheque books, tax receipt of the vehicle in the name of Naresh Ganjhu, several receipts and cash of Rs. 10,180/- were seized. Police also raided the house of Bigan Bhokta who disclosed that the levy has been collected from coal traders and D.O. Holders putting them in fear of TPC extremist organization at the rate of Rs.130/- per ton and a vast levy amount has been given to TPC extremist organization. Police raided the house of Binay Khalkho which was found locked and also raided the house of Dhanraj Bhokta from where, six challans of ""Displaced Villagers Solitary Management Committee""(Ashoka and Piparwar Area), 20 pieces of receipts of Coal Fields Loaders Association at Piparwar area and Rs. 3,74,550 cash of different denominations were recovered and seized. Dhanraj Bhokta disclosed that Rs.1,000/- per vehicle is collected by the Committee for loading coal on the vehicles and he also disclosed the name of 55 accused persons including this petitioner and some other employees of the Coal Project Committee, who were involved in such act. It is also alleged that the petitioner collects levy at the rate of Rs 1,000/- per vehicle. It is next submitted that the allegation against the petitioner is that the petitioner being the sales in-charge of Ashoka Coal Project in connivance with the other employees of the TPC extremist organization is involved in collection of illegal extortion from the transporters, coal traders and D.O. holders putting them in fear in the name of the said organization and large portion of collected money has been given to TPC Extremist Organization which is used in illegal activities. It is next submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that the TPC Extremist Organization is not a terrorist organization in terms of theSchedule A of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. It is submitted that the allegation against the petitioner is false and the petitioner is a Senior Manager in CCL (Mining) and posted as such in Ashoka Project, Piparwar. Drawing attention of this Court towards para-12 of the instant anticipatory bail application, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has no criminal antecedent. Drawing attention of this Court towards Annexure-3 page-43 of the brief, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has submitted a representation to the Director General of Police on 25.10.2019 with a request for appropriate enquiry in the matter and to delete his name from the case. It is also submitted that the co-accused, with similar allegations, has already been given the privileges of anticipatory bail by this Court vide order dated 11.02.2020 passed in A.B.A. No.8904 of 2019. It is lastly submitted that the petitioner is ready and willing to co-operate with the investigation of the case and to furnish sufficient security including cash security of Rs.50,000/-. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioner be given the privileges of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned A.P.P appearing for the State opposes the prayer for anticipatory bail of the petitioner and fairly submits that TPC organization is not a terrorist organization in terms of the provisions of the U.A.P. Act, 1967. It is next submitted that the State Government has declared the TPC as banned organization exercising the power underSection 16of Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1908. 
 Considering the submissions of learned counsels and the facts and circumstances stated above, I am inclined to grant privileges of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. Accordingly, the petitioner is directed to surrender in the Court of learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Chatra within eight weeks from today and in the event of his arrest or surrendering, he will be enlarged on bail on depositing Rs.50,000/-(Rupees fifty thousand) as cash security and on furnishing bail bond of Rs.25,000/- (Twenty five thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Chatra in connection with Piparwar P.S. Case No. 36 of 2019 with the condition that he will co-operate with the investigation of the case and appear before the investigating officer as and when noticed by him and furnish his mobile number and photocopy of the Aadhar Card with an undertaking that he will not change his mobile number during the pendency of the case and subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

 The matter was taken up through Video Conferencing. Learned counsels for the parties had no objection with it and submitted that the audio and video qualities are good. 
 --------- 
 14/ 11.09.2020. Heard learned counsels for the petitioners and the learned counsels for the State. 
 2. The writ applications filed by the petitioners were disposed of by the Judgment dated 12.08.2016, giving relief of pensionary benefits to the petitioners, but the petitioners are still running from pillar to post for getting their actual reliefs and this Court is informed that some of the petitioners-2-have also died, in the meantime, without getting their legitimate dues granted by order dated 12.08.2016 itself. 
 3. The brief facts in all the writ applications are that the petitioners were the teaching and non-teaching staffs of different Government Aided Minority Colleges in the State of Jharkhand, who have retired from their service prior to 19.12.2012. They were denied their due pension, due to the fact that there was a statute by the State Government as contained in Notification dated 19.12.2012, issued by the Principal Secretary, Department of Human Resources Development (Higher Education), Government of Jharkhand, according to which only those teaching and non-teaching staffs of different Government Aided Minority Colleges in the State of Jharkhand, were entitled to the pensionary benefits who were in service on 19.12.2012. The Writ Court in paragraph 14 its Judgment took note of this fact in the following terms:- 
 ""14. In the present case, it is to be seen as to whether there is any basis for making any cut off date between those who retired before 19.12.2012 and those who shall retire after the date of Notification i.e. 19.12.2012. But, on perusal of the impugned notification dated 19.12.2012 issued by the Principal Secretary, Department of Human Resources Development (Higher Education), Government of Jharkhand, creates two class amongst the similar situated persons by making cut off date, which is discriminatory and violative of Articles 14, 15, 16, 21, 29, 30 and 300A of the Constitution of India."" 
 4. The Writ Court disposed of the writ applications by Judgement dated 12.8.2016, holding and directing as follows:- 
 ""20. The classification in between teaching / non-teaching staffs, who retired prior to and after 19.12.2012 is not legally permissible, being hit byArticle 14of the Constitution of India, since it is an unreasonable classification. In the present case, there is no such impossibility or detriment to the public interest involved if all those who retired even prior to 19.12.2012, are extended the benefit of pension in Government Aided Minority Colleges. 
 *** *** *** 
 23. On cumulative effect of the facts, reasons and judicial pronouncements, the writ petition is disposed of with direction to the respondents to reconsider and take a decision afresh, in accordance with law in issuing a corrigendum, so that the notification dated 19.12.2012 shall apply in the same and similar-3-manner with regard to the teaching / non-teaching staffs, who have been appointed on or before 01.12.2004 and retired prior to the issuance of notification dated 19.12.2012, within a period of sixteen weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of the order."" 
 24. With the aforesaid direction, these writ petitions stand disposed of."" 
 5. Since the aforesaid order was not complied with, the petitioners were compelled to approach this Court in these contempt applications. During the pendency of these petitions, on 11 th August 2017, this Court was informed that steps have been taken for issuing the corrigendum of Notification dated 19.12.2012. However, it appears that a through a fresh Notification dated 26.04.2017, as contained in Annexure-4 to the Cont. Case (Civil) No. 378 of 2017, the statute had already been notified, wherein again, it appears that same wrong was committed, which is apparent from the following provision in the new statute:- 
 ""2. Application of Statutes- This statutes shall apply to whole time employees belonging to such teaching or non-teaching staff of the 8 degree level deficit grant Minority colleges who were in service on 19.12.12 against the sanctioned post with finance and already in receipt of deficit grant for his/her salary form the State Government of Jharkhand. 
 Provided that such teaching and non-teaching employees appointed on or after 01.12.2004 shall be governed by the New Pension Scheme of the State of Jharkhand."" 
 6. When these contempt matters were again taken up on 03.11.2017, this Court was informed that the State had preferred L.P.A. against the Judgment of the Writ Court, and taking note of the filing of the L.P.A., this Court adjourned the matters, and by order dated 20.07.2017, these matters were directed to be listed after the disposal of the LPA. 
 7. Thereafter, the order dated 06.09.2019 passed by this Court shows that the L.P.A had been dismissed by the Division Bench of this Court, but it was submitted that the State was contemplating to file S.L.P in the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India against the Judgment passed by the Division Bench in LPA. Accordingly, these matters were adjourned, giving a direction that if there was no stay by the Hon'ble Apex Court, the order passed by the Writ Court should be complied with by the next date fixed by the Court, i.e., 22.11.2019. 
 8. The matters were again taken up on 06.12.2019, when it was informed by the learned counsel for the State that actually, no SLP had been filed till date, and the State was still contemplating for filing the SLP in the Hon'ble Apex Court. This Court entertained even that plea of the State Government, but directed as follows:- 
 ""Let the matter be listed in the third week of March 2020, and it is made clear that if by that time, the order passed by the Writ Court is not complied with, in spite of there being no stay order from the Hon'ble Apex Court, the Principal Secretary, Higher and Technical Education and Skill Development Department, shall be personally present in the Court to explain the non-compliance of the order."" 
 9. Today, this Court is informed that in spite of the aforesaid order passed by the Writ Court, the order passed by the Writ Court has not yet been complied with. In the mean time even though the State Government had filed S.L.P (Civil) No.6147 of 2020 in the Hon'ble Apex Court, but the same was summarily dismissed by order dated 06.03.2020. 
 10. Today, learned counsel for the State prays for further six weeks' time for compliance of the order passed by the Writ Court, submitting that there was some difficulty in these Covid-19 pandemic days in complying of the order. 
 11. This Court is not satisfied with the explanation given by the learned counsel for the State for non-compliance of the order passed by the Writ Court till date. The footfall of the pandemic is more the reason in favour of the poor petitioners and the dependents of the deceased petitioners for expeditiously getting their legitimate dues, which is their very livelihood and much needed money for their survival in these difficult days. 
 12. I find from the record that in spite of the order passed by the Writ Court, the action of the State Government had not been fair, inasmuch as, the State Government had again come out with a fresh statute, prescribing the same cutoff date for making the persons entitled to the pensionary reliefs. Even in the fresh statute, as contained in in Annexure-4 to the Cont. Case (Civil) No. 378 of 2017, the teaching and non-teaching staff who were in service on 19.12.12 in the Government Aided Minority colleges, have only been made entitled to the pensionary benefits. This action speaks a lot about the intention of the State Government, and the fact remains that the-5-petitioners are still running from pillar to post from the year 2016 itself for getting their pensionary benefits and some of them even died. 
 13. In the aforesaid facts of the case, the time, as prayed for, by learned counsel for the State is allowed to the State Government for compliance of the order. However at the same time, taking into consideration the indifferent attitude of the State Government and the harassment to which the petitioners have been put to and still not getting their legitimate dues, the cost of Rs.50,000/- (Fifty Thousand) to be paid individually to each of the petitioner / dependent of the deceased petitioner, is hereby imposed upon the O.P. State Government for willful non-compliance of the order dated 12.08.1016 passed by the Writ Court till date. While complying the order passed by the Writ Court, the said amount of Rs.50,000/- as cost must also be disbursed to each of the petitioner / dependent of the deceased petitioner individually. 
 14. As prayed for by learned counsel for the State, put up these matters again on 27th November 2020, by which date, this Court expects that the order passed by the Writ Court, as also today's order, shall be fully complied with, failing which, this Court may be constrained to take further punitive actions against the erring opposite parties. 
 15. Let a copy of this order be made available to learned counsel for the State for the needful.

He has been transferred to Community Health Centre, Bhavanathpur, Garhwa by way of impugned order dated 17.03.2020. 
 5. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has assailed the impugned order on the ground that this impugned order has been issued on the basis of allegation and in that view of the matter it is punitive in nature and he further submits that if the order is punitive in nature, that must go. The petitioner is on deputation since, January, 2019. He further submits that in view of Annexure-8 contained in Supplementary Affidavit, the impugned order has been issued. By Annexure-8 dated 19.02.2020, the show cause submitted by the petitioner was rejected. He submits that only on the allegation of one person this transfer order has been passed. He draws the attention of the Court to the prescription contained at page no.26 of the writ petition and submits that the eye specialist has signed this prescription and the signature of this petitioner is also there. He submits that in view of this, it cannot be said that the petitioner alone has issued the prescription. The complaint is that the petitioner is not3authorized to issue prescription. He further draws the attention of the Court to page no.28 of the writ petition and submits that the duties are prescribed therein and one of the duties is to test the vision and prescribe glasses. He submits that in that view of the matter, the petitioner has not acted beyond his duty. He further submits that the case of the petitioner is fully covered in view of the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of ""Somesh Tiwari v. Union of India and Ors."" reported in (2009) 2 SCC 59 and a co-ordinate Bench judgment of this Court passed in the case of ""Ram Bihari Prasad Singh v. The State of Jharkhand & Ors."" in W.P.(S) No.329 of 2019. 
 6. Mr. Yadav, the learned counsel for the respondent State has transmitted the letter dated 10.09.2020 through e.mail and submits that letter dated 13.07.2018 has been cancelled vide letter dated 10.09.2020. 
 7. Let the transmitted e.mail document be kept on record and the reply received by the petitioner through e.mail be also kept on record. 
 8. Mr. Ashok Kumar Yadav, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent State submits that the petitioner is on deputation only and he has been found not discharging his duties diligently. The complaints were received against the petitioner. He refers to page no.20 of the writ petition and submits that this is the complaint received against the petitioner by one Dr. Pankaj Kumar, Eye Specialist, RINPAS. He further submits that the documents relied by Mr. Sharma, the learned counsel for the petitioner of 2008 is only proposed and it has not been adopted as yet. By way of referring to the Gazette notification for appointment to the post of the petitioner which has been issued underArticle 309of the Constitution of India, he submits that the duties are not prescribed. He4further submits that 06.07.2013 document is in force and thus, the 2008 document cannot be relied by the petitioner. In reply, Mr. Sharma, the learned senior counsel draws the attention of the Court to the reply and submits that this 2008 document is in force in view of this letter dated 13.07.2018 issued by the Director cum State Blind Control Officer. 
 9. Having heard the learned counsels appearing for the parties, the Court finds that the petitioner was transferred to Garhwa taking into account the letter No.42(15) dated 19.02.2020 contained in Annexure-A. By this letter, reply to the show cause filed by the petitioner has been rejected and the request was made to transfer him to any other place. The prescription annexed with the writ petition suggests that it has been signed by eye specialist wherein the signature of this petitioner is also there. Reply filed to the counter affidavit demonstrates that letter no.83(6) dated 06.06.2008 was in force. In view of these documents, the Court is not entering into this aspect of the matter as to whether the 2008 document was in force or 2013 documents are in force but the materials on record suggest that the transfer order has been issued on certain allegation. The Court also take note of this fact that the petitioner is working on deputation; to continue on a deputation post, it is not a right of the petitioner to continue on the said post, but since this order of transfer is on the basis of letter no.42(15) dated 19.02.2020 by which the show cause of the petitioner has been rejected suggests that it is punitive in nature. It is well settled provision of law that the transfer orders are being reviewed by the Court underArticle 226of the Constitution of India on a limited ground. The order of transfer is an administrative order. Generally, a transfer orders issued on administrative exigencies are not5being interfered by the Court underArticle 226of the Constitution of India. Here, in the case in hand, the materials on record suggest that it has been issued on certain allegation and in view of the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of ""Somesh Tiwari v. Union of India and Ors."" (supra) and a co-ordinate Bench judgment of this Court passed in the case of ""Ram Bihari Prasad Singh v. The State of Jharkhand & Ors."" (supra), the impugned order dated 17.03.2020 cannot sustain in the eye of law, and accordingly, it is quashed. 
 10. The Court took note of this fact that the petitioner is working there on deputation; to continue on a deputation post is not a right, and in that view of the matter, the respondent State is at liberty to take a fresh decision with regard to the transfer of the petitioner. 
 11. With the aforesaid observation and direction, the instant writ petition [W.P. (S) No. 1965 of 2020] stands allowed and disposed of. 
 12. I.A., if any, also stands disposed of.

 2. During pendency of the present appeal, the appellant no. 1, Niranjan Kumar Rai died on 15.02.2009. This fact has been brought on record by filing counter affidafit by the State. 
 3. As per the prosecution story, the present appellant, Pintu Kumar Rai has been arrested in connection with some other case and was in jail. When the appellant, Pintu Kumar Rai was taken away to Court from jail, the appellant no. 1, Niranjan Kumar Rai, who was the elder brother of the appellant no. 2, intervened and tried to pick up quarrel with the officials and tried to free his younger brother namely Pintu Kumar Rai. 
 4. On the basis of the above prosecution story, Giridih (M) P. S. Case No. 347 of 2001 has been registered. Police after completed investigation has submitted charge sheet against the appellants underSections 341/323/332/333/353/307/224/225/34of the Indian Penal Code to which cognizance has been taken and the case has been committed the Court of Sessions.

 8. It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant that appellant no. 1, Niranjan Kumar Rai has already died. It has been argued by the learned counsel for the appellant that the main allegation is against the appellant no. 1, the elder brother of the appellant no. 2, Pintu Kumar Rai and further the appellant no. 2, Pintu Kumar Rai has already been in custody for about 107 days i.e. more than three months and as such, prayer has been made for modification of the order of sentence by reducing the period of custody already undergone by Pintu Kumar Rai. It has been submitted that the incident is of the year 2001 and the order of conviction has been passed in the year 2006 and the appeal is being heard in the year 2020 and further the appellant no. 2 Pintu Kumar Rai has remained in custody during trial for 26 days and further he surrendered on 20.06.2020 and since then he is in custody. 
 8. Counsel for the State has opposed the prayer. 
 9. Perused the record. 
 From perusal of the record, it appears that the witnesses have supported the prosecution story. Injury of the officials has been proved by the doctor. There is enough material justifying the conviction of the appellants and as such requires no interference. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction dated 17.02.2006 passed by Sunil Kumar Singh, Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court-VII, Giridih in Sessions Trial No.100 of 2004 is, hereby, confirmed. So far as the sentencing part of the appellant no. 2, Pintu Kumar Rai is concerned, it is modified to the extent that his sentence is reduced to the period already undergone by considering the fact that he is in custody for more than three months and the incident is of the year 2001 and he has remained in custody twice i.e 26 days in the year 2001 and 81 days in the year 2020. So far as appellant no. 1, Niranjan Kumar Rai is concerned, he has already died so his sentencing part has become redundant and fine part is upheld. 
 10. With the above modification, the instant Appeal stands partly allowed.

 Heard the parties through video conferencing. 
 This criminal miscellaneous petition has been filed undersection 482Cr.P.C by the petitioner with a prayer for modification of the order dated 14.09.2016, passed in A.B.A. No. 3291 of 2016 to cancel the bail granted to the opposite party nos. 2 to 4. 
 It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that earlier the opposite party nos.2 to 4 of this case, admitted the occupancy rights of the petitioner in Deoghar P.S. Case No.238 of 2005 registered underSections 341/323/379/448of I.P.C.. It is next submitted that a coordinate Bench of this Court has admitted the opposite party nos.2 to 4 on bail after taking note of the fact that the disputed house and land belongs to the husband of the opposite party no.2 of this case (who was the petitioner no.1 of A.B.A. no.3291 of 2016) and father of the opposite party no.3 (who was the petitioner no.2 of A.B.A. no.3291 of 2016) and he had not executed any gift deed in favour of the petitioner herein (informant of A.B.A. no.3291 of 2016) and subsequently a proceeding was going on underSection 107Cr.P.C. between the parties for same piece of land. It is next submitted that the opposite party nos.2 to 4 have suppressed the material fact before the coordinate Bench, about the earlier case and on the basis of misrepresentation of facts and misguiding and practicing fraud upon the court by the opposite party nos.2 to 4, resulted in releasing them in the said anticipatory bail being granted in their favour. Relying upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case ofNarendra K. Amin (Dr.) v. State of Gujaratreported in (2008) 13 SCC 854, paragraph 18 of which reads as under:- 
 ""18. As is evident from the rival stands, one thing is clear that the parameters for grant of bail and cancellation of bail are different. There is no dispute to this position. But the question is if the trial court while granting bail acts on irrelevant materials or takes into account irrelevant materials whether bail can be cancelled. Though it was urged by learned counsel for the appellant that the aspects to be dealt with while considering the application for cancellation of bail and on appeal against the grant of bail, it was fairly accepted that there is no scope for filing an appeal against the order of grant of bail. Under the schemeof the Codethe application for cancellation of bail can be filed before the Court granting the bail if it is a Court of Session or the High Court."" 
 and as there is no justifiable ground to grant bail to the opposite party ns. 2 to 4, hence the bail granted to the opposite party nos.2 to 4 be cancelled. 
 Learned counsel for the opposite party nos.2 to 4 on the other hand vehemently opposes the prayer for cancellation of bail and submitted that there is no allegation of any supervening circumstances or of misconduct on the part of opposite party nos.2 to 4 consequent upon the bail being granted to them and there is no justifiable reason to cancel the bail. Hence, the prayer for cancel the bail of the opposite party nos.2 to 4 be rejected and this petition being without any merit be dismissed. 
 Having heard the submission made at the Bar and after going through the record, it is crystal clear that there is no supervening circumstance in this case for cancellation of bail in this case as there is no allegation that after being granted bail any of the Opposite party no. 2 to 4 indulge in interference or attempt to interfere with the due course of administration of justice, or evasion or attempt to evade the course of justice, or abuse of the liberty granted to them nor there is any allegation of intimidating or suborning witnesses, by interfering with investigation, by creating or causing disappearance of evidence etc. or going underground or otherwise placing themselves beyond the reach of the sureties . The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case ofRaghubir Singh v. State of Bihar, (1986) 4 SCC 481 has as under in paragraph -22 ""XxxxxxxxxxxxxGenerally the grounds for cancellation of bail, broadly, are, interference or attempt to interfere with the due course of administration of justice, or evasion or attempt to evade the course of justice, or abuse of the liberty granted to him. The due administration of justice may be interfered with by intimidating or suborning witnesses, by interfering with investigation, by creating or causing disappearance of evidence etc. The course of justice may be evaded or attempted to be evaded by leaving the country or going underground or otherwise placing himself beyond the reach of the sureties. He may abuse the liberty granted to him by indulging in similar or other unlawful acts. Xxxxxxxxx"" 
 The cancellation of bail on the ground of granting bail upon irrelevant materials or taking into account the irrelevant material can be considered by a superior court and not by the same court. Thus in the absence of any supervening circumstances, this Court is of the considered view that this is not a fit case where the bail granted in terms of the order dated 14.09.2016, passed in A.B.A. No. 3291 of 2016 is to be cancelled. 
 Accordingly, this petition being without any merit is dismissed.

 Order No.02 Dated- 11.09.2020 Heard the parties through video conferencing. Apprehending his arrest in connection with Pakuria P.S. Case No.18 of 2020 instituted underSections 323,341,325,307/34of the Indian Penal Code, the petitioner has moved this Court for grant of privileges of anticipatory bail. 
 Mr. Rajeeva Sharma- learned senior counsel for the petitioner undertakes to remove the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter within two weeks after the lockdown is over. 
 In view of personal undertaking given by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner, the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter are ignored for the present. 
 Learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the allegation against the petitioner is that the petitioner along with the co-accused persons assaulted the informant causing grievous injuries on his head and attempted to murder him. It is submitted that the allegation against the petitioner is false. It is then submitted that the petitioner has been wrongly framed by the police in this case as the brother of the petitioner who is a journalist, had published some unsavory news items against the police personnel. It is lastly submitted that the petitioner is ready and willing to co-operate with the investigation of the case and to pay ad interim victim compensation of Rs.20,000/- without prejudice to his defence in this case to the informant. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioner be given the privileges of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned A.P.P appearing for the State opposes the prayer for anticipatory bail of the petitioner. 
 Considering the submissions of learned counsels and the facts and circumstances stated above, I am inclined to grant privileges of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. Accordingly, the petitioner is directed to surrender in the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Pakur within four weeks from today and in the event of his arrest or surrendering, the petitioner will be enlarged on bail on depositing a demand draft of Rs.20,000/- as ad interim victim compensation without prejudice to his defence in this case drawn in favour of the informant of this case and on furnishing bail bond of Rs.25,000/- (Twenty five thousand) with two sureties of the like amount to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Pakur in connection with Pakuria P.S. Case No.18 of 2020 with the condition that he will co-operate with the investigation of the case and appear before the investigating officer as and when noticed by him and furnish his mobile number and photocopy of the Aadhar Card with an undertaking that he will not change his mobile number during the pendency of the case and subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 In case the petitioner deposits the said demand draft, the court below is directed to issue notice to the informant and on his proper identification, the court below shall handover the same to him forthwith.

It has been alleged that the complainant has been transporting Tyres from the godown of the petitioner to the various dealers. Certain dues to the tune of Rs. 3,21,405/- accrued regarding transportation charges but the same was not paid by the petitioner as per the allegations. 
 Mr. Yogesh Modi, learned counsel appearing for the opposite party no. 2 submits that the petitioner had undertaken to make payment of the transportation charges and even at the time of mediation the petitioner was agreeable only to compromise the matter by making payment of Rs. 1,00,000/- although an amount of Rs. 3,21,405/- is due from the petitioner. It has also been submitted that at the time of termination of the C&F agreement the petitioner had-2-received from the company a huge amount for settlement of the dues of the various vendors, transporters etc., but in spite of the same the petitioner had kept a substantial amount belonging to the opposite party no. 2. 
 On consideration of the gamut of allegations levelled against the petitioner the same does not indicate criminal culpability. The allegations are centered around the non- payment of dues to the opposite party no. 2 by the petitioner which can at best invite civil consequences. 
 In view of the aforesaid, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petitioner is accordingly directed to surrender before the learned court below within a period of four weeks and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ranchi in connection with Complaint Case No. 1236/2019, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 This application stands allowed.

 Mr. Shubhashis Rasik Soren- learned counsel for the petitioner undertakes to remove the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter within two weeks after the lockdown is over. 
 In view of personal undertaking given by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter are ignored for the present. 
 Perusal of the record reveals that vide order dated 26.11.2019 passed in A.B.A. No.8112 of 2019 interim order of provisional bail was granted to the petitioner till 13.02.2020 only in case of the petitioner being arrested by police on or before 13.02.2020 but by misrepresentation the petitioner appeared before the trial court and was released on bail by the trial court and subsequently the A.B.A. No.8112 of 2019 was withdrawn after availing the benefit of being released by the trial court, of course upon misrepresentation. Now another anticipatory bail application has been filed containing therein that the charge underSection 376of the Indian Penal Code is not maintainable and the process issued underSection 82Cr.P.C. by the trial court has been quashed by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court. Hence, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner be given the privileges of anticipatory bail Learned A.P.P appearing for the State vehemently opposes the prayer for anticipatory bail of the petitioner and submits that since by misrepresentation, the petitioner has already been released on bail by the trial court and subsequently his bail was cancelled and Non bailable warrant of arrest was issued against him hence, the second prayer for anticipatory bail of the petitioner after his appearance in the trial court and upon availing the privileges of bail for a considerable period of time is not maintainable. 
 Considering the serious nature of allegation against the petitioner and his conduct of misleading the court by suppressing material facts and also the fact that the petitioner has appeared before the trial court and availed the benefit of bail for a considerable period of time, this Court is of the considered view that it is not a fit case where the privileges of anticipatory bail be given to the petitioner. Accordingly, the prayer for anticipatory bail of the above named petitioner is rejected.

 Apprehending his arrest, the petitioner has moved this Court for grant of privilege of anticipatory bail in connection with Patratu (Bhadaninagar) P.S. Case No.214 of 2019 registered undersections 406/420/34of the Indian Penal Code. 
 The Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that earlier the anticipatory bail application was withdrawn by the petitioner. It is further submitted that the allegation against the petitioner is that the petitioner being the director of Chikor Pax defalcated 173.43 quintal of paddy purchased by Chikor Pax. It is, further, submitted that the allegation against the petitioner are all false and though Chikor Pax has handed over 300 bags of rice weighing 17343 kg to the authorized transporter but the same has not been received. It is next submitted that though 300 bags of paddy was handed over but because of printing error in paragraph no.11 of the petition, 300 bags of rice has been mentioned. It is next submitted that the transporter has not delivered the rice to the rice mill and the petitioner immediately informed the same to the District Supply Officer, Ramgarh. It is also submitted that the villagers testified that the transporter has lifted the rice form the godown and the fact that the rice has been received by the transporter is also prima facie appeared to be true from the report of the Block Supply Officer, Patratu. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned Addl. P.P. on the other hand vehemently opposes the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail and submitted that keeping in view the serious nature of allegation against the petitioner of having committed misappropriation of huge amount of paddy, the custodial interrogation of the petitioner is required during the investigation of the case for recovery of the said misappropriated paddy. It is also submitted that though the petitioner has also committed forgery but in the FIR, the same has not been specifically mentioned. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioner ought not to be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Considering the serious nature of allegation against the petitioner of misappropriating huge amount of paddy and the requirement of his custodial interrogation during the investigation of the case, this Court is of the considered view that this is not a fit case where the petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail.

 This case was listed/ supposed to be listed before the Lawazima Board for passing an order in respect of the defects, pointed out by the office. 
 Considering the pandemic situation where the Court has minimized the footfall of the lawyers and their Clerks in the Court, this court felt proper to get all the cases listed before this Court so that the defects can be looked into at this stage only. Thus, this case is listed today before this Court directly. 
 Learned senior counsel for the petitioner prays to ignore the defect and in the alternative he submits that he will remove the defect within three weeks, but, however, he submits that considering the urgency, the matter may be taken up at present on merits, ignoring the defects. 
 The petitioner, in this application, has challenged the order dated 24.01.2020, by which processes underSections 82Cr.P.C. has been issued against him. The order dated 24.01.2020 reads as follows:- 
 24.01.2020 - Received an explanation regarding address of the accused Lakhi Charan Baskey @ Lakhi Ram Baskey from the I.O. 
 Seen. Keep it with record Later on/ ""24.01.2020- A requisition has been filed by the I.O. duly forwarded by the Ld.

 Heard. Prayer is allowed. Office is directed to issue the same as prayed for."" 
 After going through the impugned order, I find that the same is non-speaking and cryptic. No satisfaction of the court has been recorded in the impugned order. The date, time and place to appear has not also been mentioned in the impugned order. 
 Thus, the impugned order dated 24.01.2020, passed by the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Jamshedpur, in G.R. No. 1867 of 2017, issuing process underSection 82Cr.P.C. against the petitioner, is hereby set aside.

 In view of personal undertaking given by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter are ignored for the present. 
 Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that earlier the prayer for anticipatory bail of the petitioner was rejected but it is jointly submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as learned counsel for the opposite party No.2 that the parties have settled the matter outside the court and good sense has prevailed between them and in this respect, learned counsel for the petitioner draws the attention of this Court towards Annexure-2 page-22 of the brief which is the copy of the certified copy of the joint compromise petition filed before the Additional Sessions Judge-VII, Giridih.

 The bail application of this applicant has already been rejected thrice by this Court. 
 As per prosecution story, five persons were involved in commission of the crime. Naresh Yadav, Pankaj Yadav and Ramadeo Yadav had executed the plan by exploding bomb. Munesh Yadav had prepared the bomb and Ashok Yadav had provided the necessary logistic and monetary support. Naresh Yadav, Pankaj Yadav and Ramdeo Yadav have already been granted bail by this Court in B.A. No. 524 of 2020, B.A. No.1161 of 2020 and B.A. No.4613 of 2018 respectively. 
 It has been argued by learned counsel for the applicant that in spite of thrice time granted by this court, the prosecution has not been able to complete the prosecution witness till date and other co-accused who have committed the crime have been released on bail and as such the applicant may be enlarged on bail. 
 On the other hand, learned counsel for the State assisted by counsel appearing for the informant has submitted that the accused, who have been granted bail, stands on different footing. Munesh Yadav is the main culprit who has prepared the bomb and on his confession, parts of the explosives substance have been recovered. Further, in his confession he has clearly admitted that he has been given necessary logistics as well as monetary support from this applicant. Further, his case has already been rejected on merit and as such the applicant does not deserve bail. 
 Heard counsel for the parties. 
 Since the accused, namely Naresh Yadav, Pankaj Yadav and Ramdeo Yadav, who have committed the crime, have already been granted bail by this Court in B.A. No. 524 of 2020, B.A. No.1161 of 2020 and B.A. No.4613 of 2018 respectively. The role of conspirator has been assigned to the present applicant and in spite of granting thrice time, the prosecution has not been able to conclude the trial by producing the witnesses till date. In present scenario, the petitioner, named above, is directed to be released on bail, on furnishing bail bonds of Rs.10,000/- (Ten thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of Addl. Sessions Judge 1st Koderma in connection with S.T. No.76 of 2018 arising out of Chandwara P.S. Case No.16/2018 corresponding to G.R.

 For the Appellant : Mr. Shailendra Kumar Singh, Advocate For the State : Mr. Azeemuddin, A.P.P. 
 ----- 
 08/11.09.2020 The present criminal appeal is taken up today through Video conferencing. 
 I.A. No. 3782 of 2020 The present interlocutory application has been filed on behalf of the appellant underSection 389(1)Cr.P.C. for suspension of sentence awarded to him vide order dated 15.03.2018 passed by the learned trial court and his release on bail during pendency of the present appeal. 
 The learned counsel for the appellant submits that earlier similar applications preferred by the appellant were rejected twice by this Court vide orders dated 04.04.2019 and 27.09.2019 passed in I.A. No. 11115 of 2018 and I.A. No. 8504 of 2019 respectively. It is further submitted that this Court while rejecting the appellant's application underSection 389(1)Cr.P.C. vide order dated 27.09.2019 passed in I.A. No. 8504 of 2019, had given liberty to prefer fresh application after completing half of the sentence. It has been stated in paragraph- 10 of the present interlocutory application that the appellant has been in judicial custody since 20.10.2016 and as such he has completed 3 years 8 months sentence out of the sentence for a period of 7 years awarded to him. It is also submitted that the appellant has good case in the present criminal appeal as the learned trial court has not appreciated the evidence available on record in true perspective and has wrongly convicted the appellant under Section 376 I.P.C. 
 The learned A.P.P. appearing on behalf of the State of Jharkhand though opposes the appellant's prayer for suspension of sentence underSection 389(1)Cr.P.C. on merit, yet he accepts the fact that the appellant has already undergone more than half of the sentence awarded to him by the learned trial court. 
 Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, on perusal of the LCR and keeping in view that the appellant has already undergone more than half of the sentence awarded by the learned trial court, I am inclined to suspend the sentence awarded to the appellant by the learned trial court vide order dated 15.03.2018. 
 Accordingly, the appellant above named is directed to be released on bail, during the pendency of the present appeal, on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned Additional Sessions Judge-XV, Dhanbad, in connection with S.T. No. 42 of 2017. 
 I.A. No. 3782 of 2020 stands disposed of.

 This case was listed/supposed to be listed before the Lawazima Board for seeking an order in respect of the defects, pointed out by the office. 
 Considering the pandemic situation where the Court has minimized the footfall of the lawyers and their clerks in the Court, this Court felt proper to get all the cases listed before this Court so that the defects can be looked into at this stage only. Thus, this case is listed today before the Court directly. 
 The defect(s) as pointed out by the office, stand ignored for the present. With the consent of the parties, the matter is taken up for hearing on merits. 
 Heard the counsel for the parties. 
 The petitioner is an accused for the offence punishable under Section(s) 15(C )/18 of theNDPS Act, in connection with MGM P.S. Case No. 69/2018 (NDPS Case No. 17/2018), pending in the court of learned Addl. Sessions Judge-IX, Jamshedpur. 
 The petitioner has renewed his prayer for bail. Earlier his prayer for bail thrice has been rejected. 
 Counsel for the petitioner submits that nothing has been recovered from possession of the petitioner and from the evidence, the prosecution cannot secure the conviction of the petitioner. He further submits that he is in custody since 7.8.2018. 
 Learned A.P.P opposes the prayer for bail of the petitioner. Since the prayer of the petitioner for bail has been rejected thrice on the ground that 08 bags of Doda (extract of opium plant) were recovered, I am not inclined to release the petitioner on bail. Accordingly, the prayer for bail of the petitioner, above named, is rejected. 
 However, trial court is directed to record the evidences of the witnesses when the courts start physically, without giving unnecessary adjournment to the parties, preferably on day to day basis."

 Order No.02 Dated- 11.09.2020 Heard the parties through video conferencing. Learned counsel for the petitioner personally undertake to remove the defects as pointed out by the stamp reporter within two weeks after the lockdown period is over. 
 In view of the personal undertaking of the learned counsel for the petitioner, the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter are ignored for the present. 
 Apprehending his arrest, the petitioner has moved this Court for grant of privilege of anticipatory bail in connection with Piparwar P.S. Case No.36 of 2019 registered undersections 385/386/387/120Bof the Indian Penal Code, Section 17 (I), (II) of C.L.A. Act and under Section 16/17/20/23 of U.A.P. Act. 
 Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Addl. P.P. for the State. 
 The Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that earlier the prayer for anticipatory bail application of the petitioner was rejected by this Court by a reasoned order dated 11.02.2020 in A.B.A. No.9012 of 2019 and the only fresh ground is that co- accused namely Md. Taj has been granted bail by a coordinate Bench. Perusal of the record reveals that the prayer for anticipatory bail of this petitioner was rejected interalia as the petitioner has made false averment in paragraph no.17 of the anticipatory bail application that he has no criminal antecedent though in fact, the petitioner is involved in Piparwar P.S. Case No.47 of 2018 for the offences underSection 147/323/384/420/406/467/468/471of I.P.C.. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the case number is Piparwar P.S. Case No.47 of 2017 but not of 2018. Hence it is submitted that the petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 The learned Addl.PP submitted that the co-accused Md. Tej had no such criminal antecedent nor he has made any false averment in his anticipatory bail application so the allegation against is petitioner stand in a graver footing than that of the co- accused Md. Tej. 
 Considering the serious nature of allegation against the petitioner and his misconduct in misrepresenting this court as well as his criminal antecedent, for the same reasons as mentioned on detail in order dated 11.02.2020 in A.B.A. No.9012 of 2019, the prayer for anticipatory bail of the petitioner is rejected.

 The petitioner is an accused for the offence punishable under Section(s) 306of the Indian Penal Code. 
 The petitioner is in custody since 1.12.2017. The prayer for bail of the petitioner was rejected thrice. The last rejection was on the ground that evidence was in progress. Now due to COVID-19, the courts are not functioning physically and the witnesses are not being examined and three witnesses are yet to be examined in this case, which is apparent from the order impugned. 
 Learned A.P.P opposes the prayer for bail of the petitioner. Consigning the period of custody and the fact that the courts are not functioning physically and the evidences are not being recorded, I am inclined to release the petitioner on bail. Accordingly, the petitioner, above named, is directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/-(Rupees ten thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned Addl. Sessions Judge-I, Chaibasa in connection with Kiriburu P.S. Case No. 09/2017 (S.T. No. 106 of 2018), with the following conditions:- 
 (1) One of the bailers should be his close relative having sufficient landed property in his/her own name within the district concerned. (2) The petitioner will not change his residential address without permission of the Court and will submit the proof of his residential address at the time of furnishing bail bond(s). 
 (3) The petitioner will appear before the Officer-in-Charge, Kiriburu Police Station (District- Chaibasa) once in a month and shall mark his attendance till completion of the trial. If he fails to appear in any particular period, his bail bonds shall stand cancelled and the Officer-in-Charge would be at liberty to arrest the petitioner. 
 I direct the Jail Authority that before releasing the petitioner from jail, the Jail Authority should get the petitioner tested for COVID-19. If the report is positive, then the District Administration will immediately take steps to isolate the petitioner and get him treated in COVID-19 Centre by following all the protocols. 
 This direction is given in the larger public interest and it should not be construed as a condition of bail."

 Defects nos. 9(i) to 9(iv) as pointed out by the office are ignored. 
 The petitioner has prayed for grant of anticipatory bail, as he is apprehending his arrest in connection with Latehar P.S. Case No. 173/2019. 
 It has been alleged that after the death of Mustkim Khan his four sons including the informant got 33.46 decimals of land in their favour. The brother of the informant namely Jamil Khan along with the nephew of the informant (petitioner) sold off the shares of the other brothers and sisters. It has further been alleged that the land was given for cultivation to Jamil Khan but it was sold and they also got the revenue receipts issued in their name. 
 The petitioner appears to be the nephew of the informant. 
 Mr. Mohit Prakash, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the main allegation of selling of the properties of the other brothers and sisters appears to be centered around Jamil Khan. It has been stated while referring to the written report that it was Jamil Khan who was instrumental in such act of fraud committed upon the informant and others. Learned counsel further submits that the petitioner has been-2-implicated merely because he happens to be the son of Jamil Khan. 
 Learned Spl. P.P. for the State has opposed the prayer for anticipatory bail made by the petitioner. 
 The allegation thus revealed that it was Jamil Khan being the brother of the informant who was the master mind of the transfer of the land in favour of other persons though he was not the absolute owner over the said lands. Save and except making vague assertions with respect to the involvement of the petitioner also in the said illegal transaction there is no other evidence which would indicate the complicity of the present petitioner. 
 Regard being had to the aforesaid facts, the petitioner, named above, is directed to surrender before the learned court below within a period of four weeks and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Latehar in connection with Latehar P.S.

Case No.305 of 2019 instituted underSections 420of the Indian Penal Code and underSections 18(c), 22 (cca), 27 (B) (II) and 22 (3) of the Drugs and Cosmetic Act, 1940, the petitioner has moved this Court for grant of privileges of anticipatory bail. 
 Mr. Anil Kr. Sinha- learned counsel for the petitioner undertakes to remove the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter within two weeks after the lockdown is over. 
 In view of personal undertaking given by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter are ignored for the present. 
 Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the petitioner filed A.B.A. No.9203 of 2019 and therein the petitioner contended that he is the owner of M/s Ashutosh Homeo Hall, Kamre, Ranchi and hence, no offence punishable under the penal provisions of Drugs and Cosmetic Act, 1940 is made out against the petitioner and vide order dated 12.02.2020 in A.B.A. No.9203 of 2019 a peremptory order was passed upon the petitioner undertaking to file a supplementary affidavit annexing therewith documents to show that he is the owner of the said shop but petitioner did not file the said affidavit rather withdrew A.B.A. No.9203 of 2019. Now the petitioner has come with the diametrically opposite plea that he is not the owner of the said M/s Ashutosh Homeo Hall, Kamre, Ranchi. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioner be given the privileges of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned A.P.P appearing for the State vehemently opposes the prayer for anticipatory bail of the petitioner and submits that the custodial interrogation is required during the investigation of the case and because of his fraudulent character also the petitioner does not deserve the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Considering the serious nature of allegation against the petitioner and his mischievous conduct of misleading the court and withdrawing the previous anticipatory bail application and thereafter filing a fresh anticipatory bail application with contradictory averments, as well as the requirement of his custodial interrogation during the pendency of the case, this Court is of the considered view that it is not a fit case where the privileges of anticipatory bail be given to the petitioner. Accordingly, the prayer for anticipatory bail of the above named petitioner is rejected.

 Considering the pandemic situation where the Court has minimized the footfall of the lawyers and their Clerks in the Court, this court felt proper to get all the cases listed before this Court so that the defects can be looked into at this stage only. Thus, this case is listed today before this Court directly. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner prays to ignore the defect and take up the matter on merits. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner undertakes to deposit the deficit court fee within two weeks from today. Rest of the defects stand ignored. 
 The petitioner, in this application, has challenged the order dated 20.10.2017, by which processes underSections 82Cr.P.C. has been issued against him. 
 Counsel for the petitioner submits that merely on the asking of the police officials, the process underSection 82Cr.P.C. has been issued. He submits that even the time, date and place to appear have not been mentioned in the order sheet. He submits that there is nothing on the record to suggest that the petitioner is absconding. 
 After going through the impugned order, I find that the same is absolutely cryptic and non-speaking and does not suggest any subjective satisfaction. No reason has been assigned while passing the impugned order issuing process underSection 82Cr.P.C. In absence of any reason and satisfaction, the order impugned is rendered bad in law. 
 Thus, the impugned order dated 20.10.2017, passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Palamau, in G.R. No. 1974 of 2016, issuing process underSection 82Cr.P.C. against the petitioner, is hereby set aside.

Drawing attention of this Court to the statement of the petitioner recorded underSection 164Cr.P.C. kept at page no.20-21, it is submitted that in his said statement underSection 164Cr.P.C., the informant has categorically stated that he was not present at the place of occurrence at the time of occurrence, rather he was at Dehri-on-son and after getting telephonic call from his sister, he came to know about the death of his mother. It is next submitted that the death of the deceased is a natural death and no case of abetment of suicide of the deceased is made out against the petitioner. It is further submitted that the deceased was leading a happy conjugal life with the petitioner and even the petitioner purchased landed property in the name of the deceased, which is evident from Annexure-3 by which the petitioner purchased the property worth Rs.3,12,500/-. It is then submitted that the petitioner is ready and willing to cooperate with the investigation of the case. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned Addl. P.P. opposes the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail. 
 Considering the submissions of the counsels and the fact as discussed above, I am of the opinion that it is a fit case where the above named petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. Hence, in the event of his arrest or surrender within a period of six weeks from the date of this order, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Railway Judicial Magistrate, Palamau at Daltonganj, in connection with Daltonganj P.S. Case No.45 of 2019 with the condition that the petitioner will cooperate with the investigation of the case and appear before the Investigating Officer as and when noticed by him and will furnish his mobile number and a copy of his Aadhar Card in the court below with the undertaking that he will not change his mobile number during the pendency of the case subject to the conditions laid down under section 438 (2) Cr.

 In view of the personal undertaking of the learned counsel for the petitioner, the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter are ignored for the present. 
 Apprehending his arrest, the petitioner has moved this Court for grant of privilege of anticipatory bail in connection with Complaint Case No.2778 of 2018 registered undersections 420/467/468/471/506/120Bof the Indian Penal Code. 
 The Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the allegation against the petitioner is that the petitioner has executed sale deed after taking a total consideration amount of Rs.55,75,000/- from the father of the complainant and sold Gair majurwa land by suppressing material facts. It is next submitted that it is also alleged that subsequently the petitioner entered into a settlement agreement with Kamlanand Jha-the father of the complainant to either sell some other land or to repay Rs.55,75,000/- but even that is not honoured by the petitioner. It is further submitted that the allegation against the petitioner are all false. It is then submitted that the petitioner is ready and willing to refund Rs. 55,75,000/- without prejudice to his defence in this case provided that the Kamlanand Jha executes a sale deed in respect of the land for which the petitioner in capacity of power of attorney holder executed the sale deed and in respect of which this case has been filed, the cost of execution of which will be borne by the petitioner. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail.

 Considering the submissions of the counsels and the fact as discussed above, I am of the opinion that it is a fit case where the above named petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. Hence, in the event of his arrest or surrender within a period of four months from the date of this order, the petitioner shall be released on bail on depositing a demand draft of Rs. 55,75,000/- drawn in favour of Kamlanand Jha and on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned J.M. 1st Class, Ranchi, in connection with Complaint Case No.2778 of 2018 subject to the conditions laid down under section 438 (2) Cr.

 Order No. 02 Dated 11th September, 2020 Heard the learned counsel for the respective sides. The defects, as pointed out by the office, are ignored. The petitioners apprehend their arrest in connection with Karon P.S. Case No.74 of 2018. 
 The marriage of the informant was solemnized with the petitioner no.1 in the year 2008. It has been alleged that after some time, there was a demand of a motorcycle and cash of Rs.1,00,000/- as well as a cow. On 01.09.2019, she was assaulted and ousted from her matrimonial house. 
 The petitioner no.1 appears to be the husband of the informant while the petitioner nos.2 and 3 are the parents-in-law and the petitioner no.4 appears to be the grand mother-in-law of the informant. The First Information Report appears to be replete with allegations against the petitioner no.1. 
 In such circumstances, I am not inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner no. 1. This application is accordingly rejected as against him. 
 So far as the petitioner nos.2, 3 and 4 are concerned, since the allegation against them are general and omnibus in nature, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner nos. 2, 3 and 4. 
 Accordingly, the petitioner nos. 2, 3 and 4, named above, are directed to surrender before the learned court below within four weeks from today and on such surrender, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- (Ten Thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned J.M.

 Learned A.P.P. opposes the prayer for bail. 
 The petitioner is an accused for allegedly committing an offence punishable under Sections 376(2) (i), 341, 307/34IPCand Section 8/10 of POCSO Act. 
 Petitioner is in custody since 01.09.2018 i.e more than two years. On the last occasion the prayer for bail of the petitioner was rejected on 19.9.2019 which is nearly one year ago. 
 Considering the period of custody and the fact that trial is not yet concluded, I am inclined to allow this application. Accordingly, the petitioner above named is directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned District & Additional Sessions Judge-I-cum-Children Court, Hazaribag in connection with Katkamdag Police Station Case No. 96 of 2018 (G.R. No. 108 of 2019), (Spl. POCSO Case No. 19 of 2019), subject to the condition that petitioner shall appear before trial court once in a month virtually or physically, failing which, court below will take appropriate steps for his re- arrest. Further condition that one of the bailers should be a close relative of the petitioner, having sufficient landed properties and the petitioner will not change his residence without permission of the trial court. 
 I direct the Jail Authority that before releasing the petitioner from Jail, the Jail Authority should get the petitioner tested for Covid-19. If the report is positive, then the District Administration will immediately take steps to isolate the petitioner and get him treated in the COVID Centre by following all the protocols. 
 This direction is given in the larger public interest and it should not be construed as a condition of bail.

 This case was listed/supposed to be listed before the Lawazima Board for seeking an order in respect of the defect(s), pointed out by the office. 
 Considering the pandemic situation where the court has minimized the footfall of the lawyers and their clerks in the court, this court felt proper to get all the cases listed before this Court so that the defect(s) can be looked into at this stage only. Thus, this case is listed today before this Court directly. 
 Defect(s) as pointed out by the office, if any, is ignored for the present. The petitioner is an accused for allegedly committing an offence punishable underSections 302/34IPC. 
 Prayer for bail of the petitioner was twice rejected. The trial is in progress. Learned counsel for the State opposes the prayer for bail. Seeing the nature of allegation where the deceased was murdered, I am not inclined to allow this application. Accordingly, the prayer for bail of the petitioner above named in connection with Bankmore P.S. Case No. 33 of 2018, corresponding to G.R. No. 502 of 2018, (S.T.

 The petitioner, in this application, has challenged the order dated 20.08.2015, issuing summon to the petitioner, on the ground that nothing has been mentioned as to what are the materials to proceed against the petitioner. 
 I have gone through the complaint. I find that a complaint has been registered for the offence punishable underSections 341,323,498A,494,379/34IPC. The petitioner is the husband. There is allegation of demand of dowry and torture upon the complainant by the husband. When in a complaint allegations, which constitute an offence, is made out, the order taking cognizance cannot be quashed. 
 Considering the aforesaid fact, this application stands dismissed. However, the petitioner would be at liberty to raise all the points, which have been raised in this application, at an appropriate stage.

 Heard the learned counsel for the respective sides. The defects, as pointed out by the office, is ignored. The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Jasidih P.S. Case No. 61 of 2019. 
 The informant was having a landed property which was recorded in the name of Yadunandan Jha and Janardan Jha. The land is a joint property of all the heirs and the descendants. It has been alleged that the petitioner along with the co-accused in order to grab the land in conspiracy with the co-accused persons had prepared the forged lease agreement in favour of BSNL for installing a mobile tower in the year 2010. It has further been alleged that the petitioner obtained Rs. 6,000/- per month as rent of the said joint property on account of setting up of the mobile tower. 
 It appears that a partition suit is pending between the legal heirs in which the petitioner has been arrayed as defendant No. 17. It further appears that the First Information Report was instituted after nine years from the date of execution of the lease agreement. The mobile tower was installed in the year 2011 and it took more than 8 years for the informant to institute a case making several allegations against the petitioner. The allegations therefore reveal that the same is an outcome of the civil dispute existing between the parties since long. The witnesses to the lease agreement have already been granted anticipatory bail by this Court in ABA 1857 of 2020. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petitioner2.accordingly is directed to surrender before the learned trial court within four weeks from today and on such surrender, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Deoghar in connection with Jasidih P.S.

 Order No. 02 Dated 11st September, 2020 Heard the learned counsel for the respective sides. The defects, as pointed out by the office, are ignored. The petitioners apprehend their arrest in connection with Seraikella P.S. Case No. 96 of 2019. 
 The informant is a registered firm which is represented through its sole Director Ashok Kumar Agrawal. The informant is engaged in acquiring land in different locations for industrial and other purposes. It has been alleged that the accused No. 1 had offered himself as a facilitator and assured the informant to get the land in Mouja Zordih transferred in the name of the informant from the land owners by way of sale deeds. An agreement for sale was executed by the general power of attorney holder in favour of the informant. It has further been alleged that the informant had paid Rs. 46 Lakhs as part consideration amount to the accused No. 1. However, the land was never transferred and instead of selling the land to the informant, it was alienated to the others. 
 It appears that the role of the petitioner has been limited only with respect to being the witnesses to the sale deeds. One of the land owners has been granted anticipatory bail by this Court although subject to deposit of Rs. 5 Lakhs as ad interim victims' compensation in ABA No. 1545 of 2020. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioners. The petitioners accordingly are directed to surrender before the learned trial court within four weeks from today and on such surrender, they shall be released on bail2.on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Seraikella in connection with Seraikella P.S.

 An illicit relationship had developed between the petitioner and the informant. It has been alleged that on the false pretext of marriage she was taken to his house where she was subjected to rape and assault. Later on the petitioner refused to solemnize marriage. 
 It appears from the 164Cr.P.C. statement of the victim that although she has reiterated what has been stated by her in the First Information Report but she has further stated that she is already a married women. 
 Thus there appears to be an apparent consent on the part of the informant as in spite of knowing about her marital status she willingly allowed herself to get into an illicit relationship with the petitioner. 
 In view of the statement recorded u/s 164Cr.P.C. of the informant, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner.

 2. Learned counsel for the petitioner/ appellant has submitted that P.W.-9 has made embellishment and improvement in his testimony vis-a-vis the narration in F.I.R wherein he has not mentioned that P.Ws.-6 & 7 were present with him at the time of occurrence and this has been corroborated in paras-31 & 35 of cross-examination by the Investigating Officer. 
 It is argued that no medical prescription or cash memo has been produced to establish the case of the prosecution that P.W.-9 had gone to purchase the medicines neither the medicine shop-keeper has been examined by the prosecution. It is contended that, in fact, the prosecution's case is riddled with contradiction and there is a prima-facie case for suspension of sentence and grant of ad-interim bail to the appellant. 
 3. Learned A.P.P., assisted by learned counsel for the informant, has opposed the prayer for bail and submitted that vide order dated 21.10.2019, on consideration of the testimony of P.Ws.- 6, 7 & 9, the prayer for suspension of sentence has been rejected by this Court.

 It has been alleged that during the lock down the petitioner no. 1 was involved in repairing of mobiles in his shop which attracted a substantial crowd. The informant tried to stop such assemblage of people and on 08.05.2020, it has been alleged that all the accused persons variously armed had started assaulting the informant and his companions. 
 It appear that the petitioner no.7 had also lodged a case which had been registered as Jharia P.S. Case No. 98 of 2020. The impugned order reveals that Bablu Verma and Akash Verma had sustained injuries and one of the injuries sustained by Bablu Verma appears to be grievous in nature. The entire incident appears to be on account of a free fight between both the sides which resulted in institution of a case and counter case. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioners. The petitioners, named above, are directed to surrender before the learned court below within four weeks from today and on such surrender, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- (Ten Thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned A.C.J.M., Dhanbad in connection with Jharia P.S.

 Defects, as pointed out by the office, are ignored. The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with C/1 Case No. 104 of 2019. 
 It has been alleged that the accused persons had entered into a sale agreement dated 30.11.2017 with the complainant. It has further been alleged that out of a total consideration amount of Rs.45,00,000/-, Rs.42,32,000/- had been paid through cash and cheque. However, the sale deed was not executed and registered. The accused had given a cheque of Rs.42,32,000/- to the complainant, which subsequently got dishonored. 
 It appears that the complainant had also filed a case against the son of the petitioner undersection 138of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Petitioner seems to have been implicated on account of she being the mother of the main accused-B Surya Rao, who had orchestrated the deal and who is also the sole accused in the case undersection 138of the N.I. Act instituted by the complainant. Petitioner appears to be aged about 75 years. 
 Considering the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. 
 Accordingly, the petitioner, named above, is directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, she will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- ( Ten thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st class, Jamshedpur in connection with C/1 Case No. 104 of 2019, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

 Order No. 02 Dated 11st September, 2020 Heard the learned counsel for the respective sides. The defects, as pointed out by the office, is ignored. The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Cyber P.S. Case No. 31 of 2019. 
 It has been alleged that the informant had deposited Rs. 8,65,000/- in the account for getting distributorship of Patanjali products. No goods were ever supplied to him which resulted in institution of F.I.R. 
 It appears that the account in which the amount was deposited by the informant belongs to one Ranjit Kumar. The petitioner has been implicated on account of the confession of Ranjit Kumar as well as the fact that the motorcycle of the petitioner was seized though the petitioner had managed to escape. It therefore appears that the petitioner has been implicated merely on suspicion and as stated by learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner also does not have any criminal antecedent. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petitioner accordingly is directed to surrender before the learned trial court within four weeks from today and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned District & Additional Sessions Judge-II, Giridih in connection with Cyber P.S.

 ------ 
 07/14.09.2020 Heard Mr. Abhay Kumar Mishra, learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Mohan Kumar Dubey, learned counsel for respondents-State and Mr. Sanjay Piprawall, learned counsel for the respondent-JSSC. 
 2. This writ petition has been heard through Video Conferencing in view of the guidelines of the High Court taking into account the situation arising due to COVID-19 pandemic. None of the parties have complained about any technical snag of audio-video and with their consent this matter has been heard. 
 3. The petitioner has preferred this writ petition for quashing the order dated 29.10.2018 contained in Annexure-8 whereby the petitioner has been discharged from the service. 
 4. Mr. Abhay Kumar Mishra, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that an advertisement was issued by Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission being Advertisement No.04 of 2015 for appointment on the post of Constable in the entire district of the State of Jharkhand. The petitioner applied for appearance in the said2examination and she mentioned her category as EBC-I in the on line application submitted on 15.10.2015 contained in Annexure-3. Mr. Mishra submits that her counselling was conducted on 02.01.2017. During the counselling, the petitioner has submitted her caste certificate dated 24.12.2016 which was issued by the Sub Divisional Officer, Chas, District-Bokaro. After counselling, the petitioner submitted an application to the Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission stating that she did not had online caste certificate and she has been asked for such caste certificate which she is submitting through this application. She succeeded in selection process and she was allowed to discharge her duty continuously. She received a letter from Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission dated 01.06.2018 asking the petitioner to explain her reservation category. The petitioner submitted reply on 11.08.2018 stating that she did not suppress any fact and that in the off line issued caste certificate it was not mentioned whether her caste certificate belonged to B.C.-I or B.C.-II category. In the light of above, Mr. Mishra submitted that there is no misrepresentation on behalf of petitioner and in spite of that petitioner has been discharged from service. 
 5. Mr. Mishra assailed the impugned order on the ground that without any show cause and without any departmental proceeding, petitioner has been dismissed from the service. He further submits that the case of Mithun Kumar in W.P.(S) No.3239 of 2017 decided on 05.08.2020 by this Court is not applicable in the facts and circumstances of this case as Mithun Kumar case was only on the ground of re-examination of medical test of the candidates. He further submits that in the case of Anil Tanti in L.P.A. No.618 of 2017, it has been decided that caste certificate after the cut-off date may be considered. On these grounds, Mr. Mishra submits that the case of petitioner is fit to be allowed. 
 6. Per contra, Mr. Sanjay Piprawall, learned counsel for the respondent-Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission submits that Clause-4 of the advertisement is self-explanatory. In Clause-4 of the3prospectus, it has been mentioned in specific terms that candidates are required to satisfy himself before submission of application form that they are fulfilling the terms and conditions of the advertisement and mere issuance of the admit card, does not give right for appointment and Commission after conducting the examination will verify the testimonials of the candidate and after verification of the testimonials, the Commission will take final decision about eligibility of the candidate and at any time candidature of a candidate can be rejected due to non-fulfillment of eligibility criteria. He draws the attention of this Court towards Clause-8 of the advertisement and submits that reserved category candidates who claimed benefits of reservation were required to submit caste certificate issued not below the rank of Sub Divisional Officer in a proforma as indicated in prospectus. He further submits that petitioner had submitted on line application form for consideration of her candidature under E.B.C.-I category but at the time of verification, she had submitted caste certificate of B.C.-II category. He also submits that this fact has not been fulfilled by the petitioner that is why the petitioner's services has been recommended to be terminated by Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission. He draws the attention of the Court towards letter dated 01.06.2018 and submitted that in view of provision the person who has wrongly applied in a reserved category their candidature was kept pending in the recast result. He submits that the petitioner has obtained 110 marks whereas the last candidate, who has been selected in the reserved category, has obtained 117 marks. In that view of the matter, the petitioner is not entitled to be continued. He submits that in the case of Mithun Kumar it has been directed that merit list required to be re-casted, therefore, while re-casting merit list this anomaly has come to JSSC and that is why that recommendation has been made. He submits that Anil Tanti case is not applicable in this case as in that case caste certificate was submitted later on wherein in the present case caste certificate has already been submitted as E.B.C.-I4and while counselling, caste certificate of B.C.-II has been submitted. He relied on the judgment in the case of ""Rohan Thakur Versus State of Jharkhand & Others reported in 2019 (3) JBCJ 44 (HC) particularly para 6 and 7 which is quoted hereinbelow:- 
 6. Learned counsel for the State of Jharkhand submitted that the Advertisement No.10 of 2015 specifically mentioned requirement of certificate issued by competent authority like Deputy Commissioner/Sub Divisional Officer issuing caste certificate which could be utilized for availing reservation in this examination. Since the application was invited through online process and the requirement was to upload self- attested scanned copy of certificate including certificates for availing reservation otherwise the candidate will be treated under general category and once the online application has been filled up then no alteration would be allowed or granted after the last date of receipt of online application. Learned counsel for the State submitted that the decision relied on behalf of the petitioner was that reservation certificate were submitted after expiry of submission of application form but those decisions are not applicable in present case as in the advertisement itself the requirement was of online submission of caste certificate issued and uploaded upto the last date of submission of application form i.e. 17.12.2015 and it was thus mandatory for the candidate to possess caste certificate in prescribed format issued by the competent authority. Admittedly, this petitioner was having a caste certificate issued on 29.08.2012 from which the petitioner could not derive any claim under the reserved category. Admittedly, the case is not of a late submission of caste certificate but is a case of not uploading the proper certificate which was not issued upto the last date of submission. 
 7. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the papers attached with this application as well as the counter affidavit filed on behalf of respondent, it would appear that the prayer of the petitioner was to order to constitute an Interview Board for conducting interview of the petitioner as a special case. Alternative prayer is for quashing of Advertisement No.10 of 2015 issued by Jharkhand Public Service Commission and quashing of Clause No.13 of the said advertisement, is illegal, arbitrary and unconstitutional as the case of competitive examination involving candidates with nil experience is made eligible by Rules and even the quashing of Rule 16(D) of Jharkhand Judicial Service (Rules), 2004 prescribed for fixation of minimum qualifying marks in interview. This petitioner was aggrieved by the manner in which the Jharkhand Public Service Commission initially treated him as reserved category candidate during holding of Preliminary examination and allowed him to appear in the Main examination but at the time of declaration of Main examination treated his candidature as an unreserved category candidate. The reason being that the caste certificate uploaded by the petitioner was not found proper. So far as the decisions relied upon by this petitioner including the case of Ram Kumar Gijroya (supra) and the decisions in L.P.A. No.610 of 2017 with L.P.A. No.618 of 2017 of this High Court, in all these cases the requirement of submission of certificate within a cut-off date was not mentioned in the advertisement but the same was introduced before declaration of result. In those cases, certificates were submitted by the candidate after cut-off date so it was case of late submission of caste certificate although submission of caste certificate was not a requirement in the advertisement. In the present case, the requirement of submission/uploading of caste certificate issued till a particular date i.e. last date of submission of online application form and keeping the original copy of caste certificate to be produced by the concerned candidate at the time of interview during course of verification of testimonials was specifically mentioned in the advertisement. The petitioner did submit the scanned copy of the certificate but the same was found not proper. Therefore his candidature was treated to be from unreserved category, while the results of main examination were processed. Therefore, in this situation, prayer of petitioner could not be5allowed at belated stage as process for filling of the post of Advertisement No.10 of 2015 was over and subsequent to this advertisement, another Advertisement No.11 of 2015 was issued and this petitioner had appeared for interview and process of appointment in that advertisement have completed by now. Therefore, the prayer of petitioner cannot be acceded at this stage. Before us, argument of the writ petitioner was advanced on this point only and other prayers pertaining to declaration of certain provisions of Selection Rules as illegal were not really pressed. Moreover, as we find nothing illegal in rejection of the petitioner from the list of successful candidates as per Rules, discussion on other issues would have become merely academic exercise. 
 7. Mr. M.K. Dubey, learned counsel appearing for respondents- State submits that in view of Rule 668 of Police Manual, the petitioner can be dismissed without any show cause. 
 Rule 668 of the Jharkhand Police Manual is quoted hereinbelow:- 
 668. Removal or reversion of officers appointed direct or promoted on probation:-- The following rules shall govern first appointments and the promotion of police and ministerial officers as detailed in Appendix 41:-- 
 (a) All officers shall in the first instance be appointed or promoted on probation. Where the period of probation is not otherwise provided for in the rules it shall be for a period of two years in the case of executive officers and one year in the case of ministerial officers. The authority authorised to make such appointment or promotion, may at any time during such probationary period and without the formalities laid down in Rule 828, remove an executive officer directly appointed or revert such an officer promoted who has not fulfilled the conditions of his appointment or who has shown himself unfit for such appointment or promotion. Similarly, probationary period may also be extended without any show cause. No appeal shall he in such cases. 
 (b) Executive Officers appointed or promoted in other than permanent vacancies are also liable to removal or reversion in the manner indicated in clause (a) above."" 
 8. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, the Court finds that petitioner has applied for the post in the category E.B.C.-I wherein she has submitted caste certificate of B.C.-II category at the time of counselling. Clause-9 of the advertisement is very clear that caste certificate was required to be submitted as indicated in the advertisement. The petitioner submitted caste certificate of B.C. II at the time of counselling whereas on line application, she submitted caste certificate of E.B.C. I. In view of letter dated 01.06.2018, it is also clear that the petitioner has obtained 110 marks whereas last candidate in her category has obtained 117 marks. Show cause has been issued to the petitioner contained in Annexure-C of the counter affidavit filed by Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission. 
 It is well settled principle of law that every selection process6has to be complied strictly in terms of criteria mentioned in Advertisement as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of ""Bedanga Talukdar Versus Saifudaullah Khan & Others reported in (2011) 12 SCC 85 which reads as under :- 
 29. We have considered the entire matter in detail. In our opinion, it is too well settled to need any further reiteration that all appointments to public office have to be made in conformity withArticle 14of the Constitution of India. In other words, there must be no arbitrariness resulting from any undue favour being shown to any candidate. Therefore, the selection process has to be conducted strictly in accordance with the stipulated selection procedure. Consequently, when a particular schedule is mentioned in an advertisement, the same has to be scrupulously maintained. There cannot be any relaxation in the terms and conditions of the advertisement unless such a power is specifically reserved. Such a power could be reserved in the relevant statutory rules. Even if power of relaxation is provided in the rules, it must still be mentioned in the advertisement. In the absence of such power in the rules, it could still be provided in the advertisement. However, the power of relaxation, if exercised, has to be given due publicity. This would be necessary to ensure that those candidates who become eligible due to the relaxation, are afforded an equal opportunity to apply and compete. Relaxation of any condition in advertisement without due publication would be contrary to the mandate of equality contained in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. 
 The case of Rohan Thakur (supra) has already been affirmed by Hon'ble Supreme Court. Rule 668 of Jharkhand Police manual is self-explanatory. Therefore, no case of interference is made out. 
 9. Accordingly, writ petition is dismissed.

 ------ 
 09/14.09.2020 Heard Mr. Rajendra Krishna, learned counsel for the petitioners and Mr. Mithilesh Singh, learned counsel for respondents-State. 
 2. This writ petition has been heard through Video Conferencing in view of the guidelines of the High Court taking into account the situation arising due to COVID-19 pandemic. None of the parties have complained about any technical snag of audio-video and with their consent this matter has been heard. 
 3. The petitioners have preferred this writ petition for quashing of order dated 01.02.2019 contained in Annexure-15 by which respondents have denied the claim of the petitioners for payment of pay scale of Rs.8000-13,500/- w.e.f. 15.11.2000 which is upgraded pay scale of Rs.6500- 10,500/-. 
 4. The case of the petitioners is that they belong to officers of Sub- 
 ordinate Education Service and their next promotional post was State Education Service Class-II. The minimum qualification period is eight years and all the petitioners have completed more than twelve years in Sub-ordinate service and they are entitled for grant of promotion in State Education Service Class-II. By way of Rule 41 of Bihar Education Code, the petitioners have been granted pay scale of Rs.6500-10,500/- as per 1st ACP scheme which was pay scale of the then State Education Service Class-II. The pay scale of Rs.6500-10,500/- has been upgraded to Rs.8000- 13,500/- by resolution memo no.3589 dated 17.12.2007 and therefore, the petitioners are also entitled to pay scale of Rs.8000-13,500/-. The petitioners have earlier moved in W.P.(S) No.1683 of 2010 which was disposed of on 24.11.2017 with a direction to respondent nos.2 and 3 to take a decision on the representation of petitioners and pass detailed reasoned order considering the resolution of Finance Department dated 17.12.2007 and also order dated 05.12.2006 passed in W.P.(S) No.6350 of 2006. This order was challenged before Division Bench in L.P.A. No.23 of 2018 and the Division Bench of this Court modified the order of Single Judge only to the effect that without being influenced by the order passed by learned Single Judge, independently on the basis of law, rules, regulations and evidence the decision shall be taken upon the representation of the original petitioner. Pursuant to that, the petitioners filed representation and by impugned order dated 01.02.2019, the claim of the petitioners has been rejected. Now in second round litigation, the impugned order dated 01.02.2019 has been challenged. 
 5. Mr. Rajendra Krishna, learned counsel for the petitioners assailed the impugned order on the ground that the Clause 3(X) of the resolution dated 14.08.2002 has wrongly been interpreted in the case of the petitioners. He further submits that the resolution no.3589 dated 17.12.2007 has also wrongly been interpreted. To substantiate his argument, he submits that byAmendment Act, 1963, Rule 776 of Education Code has been affirmed by way of proviso 309 of Constitution of India which was superseded by the rules published by the Education Department earlier. He submits that source of recruitment is disclosed in Rule 3 ofAmendment Act, 1963. By way of referring Rule 3 (c) he submits that promotion in accordance with the rules in Part IV is prescribed. For ready reference, Rule 3 is quoted hereinbelow:- 
 3. Source of recruitment :- The Bihar Education Service (Class I) and the Bihar Education Service (Class II) shall be recruited - a. By direct recruitment through combined competitive examination in accordance with the Rules in Part II, and/or b. By open advertisement in accordance with the rules in Part III and/or c. By promotion in accordance with the rules in Part IV, and/or, d. By direct recruitment (special recruitment) in accordance with the rules in Part V. 
 6. He further refers to Rule 4 and by way of referring Rule 4(2)(iii), he submits that for promotion of officers of the Upper Division of the Subordinate Educational Service (inspection and allied branch) in accordance with rules in Part IV, 50% of the posts are prescribed. For sake of convenience, Rule 4(2) is quoted hereinbelow:- 
 (2) Appointment to the posts of District Superintendent of Education, Sub Divisional Education Officer, Principal, Primary Teacher's Education College, District Inspectors of Schools and allied posts of inspecting and administrative nature shall be made as follows:- 
 (i) By direct recruitment in accordance with the rules in Part II- in 30% of posts 
 (ii) By open advertisement in accordance with the rules in Part III- in 50% of the posts 
 (iii) By promotion of officers of the Upper Division of the Subordinate Educational Service (inspection and allied branch) in accordance with the rules in Part IV 
 7. He draws the attention of this Court towards Part IV of the rule which is indicated in Rule 4 and by way of referring Rule 39 he submits that in rules 4(b) and 4(c), promotion to Class II officers of Bihar Educational Service is prescribed. Rule 39 is quoted hereinbelow:- 
 39. For promotion to Class II of the Bihar Educational Service, exempting the branches mentioned in Appendix 'C' cases of all eligible officers of Subordinate Educational Service shall be considered in accordance with rules 4(b) and 4(c). 
 8. He refers to Rule 41 of Bihar Education Code in which promotion to next higher rank has been disclosed. Rule 41 is quoted hereinbelow:- 
 41. An officer must have rendered the following minimum qualifying period of service for being eligible for promotion to the next higher rank :- 
 9. He draws the attention of this Court towards A.C.P. scheme dated 14.08.2002 and submits that Clause 3(X) of the A.C.P. scheme not interpreted in the case of the petitioners rightly. He submits that in Clause 3(X) promotional hierarchy is not there and it is below two posts. Thus, it4is not applicable. He submits that in the case of petitioners, 50% of promotional avenue is reserved for Class II. He further took to Annexure- 10 which is letter dated 21.08.2017 and submits that in the case of Jan Sewak, Government has provided the pay scale of Junior Engineers wherein 25% posts is reserved for Block Agriculture Officer is prescribed. He further draws the attention of this Court towards Annexure-9 which is letter dated 12.08.2011 which has been issued in light of resolution of Finance Department dated 17.12.2007 whereby Juniors Engineers have been provided pay scale of Rs.8000-13,500/-. He submits that when the Government Departments have provided this scale, the petitioners have been wrongly provided the scale of Rs.6500-10,500/-. By way of referring letter dated 19.02.2009 contained in Annexure-5 he submits that in view of para (iii), promotional post of petitioners' service is 181. By way of referring this annexure, he submits that it cannot be said that there is restricted number of posts of cadre of petitioner. Letter dated 19.02.2009 itself discloses that there is substantive number of posts of cadre of petitioners. By way of referring Annexure-8 dated 01.07.2009, he submits that the persons who were employed in the cadre of petitioners, have been promoted to the next higher posts in Class II. By way of referring this annexure, he submits that it is self-explanatory that next promotional post of petitioners' cadre is in Class II and the pay scale is Rs.8000- 13,500/-. 
 10. Per contra, Mr. Mithilesh Singh, learned counsel appearing for respondents-State submits that there is no illegality in the impugned order as the petitioners were getting pay scale of Rs.5500-9000/- and the next higher grade of scale is Rs.6500-10,500/- and that is why they have been rightly provided the same pay scale. He submits that Clause 3(X) is very clear wherein it has been described that if the promotional post is limited, the same cannot be provided to the petitioners. By way of referring Clause 3(X) of memo dated 14.08.2002, he submits that an employee would be entitled to the scale of next higher post on grant of the benefit of A.C.P. if at least two promotional posts are available in their hierarchy of the cadre of the employee. In the case of petitioners, there are less than two promotional posts and only some percentage of the next higher posts are earmarked to be filled up by promotion. He submits that in terms of resolution dated 14.08.2002 and 18.12.2007, the employees5would be entitled to the next higher scale on grant of A.C.P. as indicated in schedule-1 to the said resolution. 
 11. In the light of above submission, the Court proceeded to examine argument of learned counsel for the parties. It transpires from going through the rules which are quoted hereinabove that 50% posts of promotion for Upper Division Sub ordinate Service is there in the light of Rule 3(c). Rule 4(2) and Rule 39 prescribe that eligible officers of Sub ordinate Education Service shall be considered in accordance with Rule 4(b) and Rule 4(c). For promotion, Rule 41 suggests the next higher rank of Sub ordinate Education Service is Bihar Education Service Class II. The minimum qualification period is eight years in Sub-ordinate Education Service (U.D.) in Bihar Education Service Class II. The minimum qualification is eight years in Bihar Education Service Class I for Bihar Education Service Class II and minimum qualification of 5 years in Selection Grade Posts in Bihar Education Service I in Bihar Education Service Class I. The letter dated 19.02.2009 discloses that 181 posts for promotion to State Education Service Class-II is there. The Clause 3(X) of A.C.P. scheme dated 14.08.2002 is not applicable in the case of petitioners as it is crystal clear from the above rules that promotional avenues are there in the light of Rules 3, 4, 39 and 41. This fact is fortified in the light of notification dated 01.07.2009 whereby the persons of cadre of petitioners have been promoted to the higher posts of Class II in the pay scale of Rs.8000-13,500/-. By resolution memo no.3589 dated 17.12.2007 of Finance Department, prescribed pay scale of Government employees which was Rs.6500/-10,500/- has been upgraded to the pay scale to Rs.8000-13,500/-. In the similar circumstances, Jan Sewak and Junior Engineers have been provided the same pay scale of Rs.8000-13,500/-. Thus in view of reasons mentioned above, the impugned order whereby the claim of the petitioner has rejected, does not survive. Accordingly, the impugned order dated 01.02.2009 is quashed. 
 12. The respondents-State is directed to fix the pay scale of the petitioners as has been done in the case of the promoted persons by way of notification dated 01.07.2009. 
 13. The writ petition stands allowed and disposed of.

 --- 
 For the Petitioners : Mr. Vijay Kumar Roy, Advocate (In both cases) For the State : Mrs. Vandana Bharti, A.P.P. 
 (In both cases) For the O.P. No. 2 : Mr. Sahadeo Choudhary, Advocate (In Cr. Rev. No. 1203 of 2013) Through Video Conferencing 12/14.09.2020 
 1. Heard Mr. Vijay Kumar Roy, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners in both the cases. 
 2. Heard Mrs. Vandana Bharti, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party-State in both the cases. 
 3. Heard Mr. Sahadeo Choudhary, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the claimant in Cr. Revision No. 1203 of 2013. 
 4. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the impugned judgments are perverse and fit to be set aside in revisional jurisdiction. Learned counsel while advancing his argument has submitted that the Deoki Devi been convicted underSection 494of IPC alleged to be second wife. On the one hand second marriage was not proved through cogent evidence and on the other hand she could not have been convicted underSection 494of the Indian Penal Code as she was unmarried on the date of her alleged marriage. Learned counsel submit that2in the present case the priest who conducted the second marriage has not been examined and the Saptpadi was not proved and the second marriage itself has not been proved and therefore conviction of the petitioner Deoki Devi and Mohan Mahto underSection 494IPC is not sustainable in the eyes of law. The learned counsel has further submitted that so far as offence underSection 498-Ais concerned, the marriage was solemnized between the complainant and Mohan Mahto long back and the basic ingredients ofSection 498-Aof the Indian Penal Code has not been satisfied by the prosecution and therefore the conviction underSection 498-Ais also not sustainable in the eyes of law. He submitted that on the one hand conviction underSection 494of the Indian Penal Code is based on no evidence and on the other hand conviction under basic ingredients of offenceSection 498-Aof Indian Penal Code has not been satisfied. 
 5. Learned counsel has relied upon the following judgments in support of his submissions: 
 2002(1) Eastern Criminal Cases 374 (SC) Paul George versus State; 
 2002(1) Eastern Criminal Cases 300 (Pat) Rabindra Prasad Verma vs. State of Bihar; 
 (2007) 2 Eastern Criminal Cases 464 (Jhr.)Reshmi Kewtain vs. State of Bihar(2008) 1 Eastern Criminal Cases 161 (Jhr.)Bhakti Bala Dasi vs. Baldeo Pandit(2008) 1 Eastern Criminal Cases 162 (Jhr.)Dinesh Choudhary vs. State of Jharkhand(2012) 2 Eastern Criminal Cases (Pat) Nagendra Mahto vs. State of Bihar (2009) 3 Eastern Criminal Cases S.C. 321 para 23. 
 6. Without prejudice to the aforesaid submissions, learned counsel has also submitted that the petitioner Mohan Mahto3has remained in custody for the period of 10 month 19 days at the stage of trial and the petitioner Chundari Devi being the mother-in-law has remained in custody for the period of two months two days and the petitioner Deoki Devi has remained in custody for the period of 1 month seven days. The present age of Mohan Mahto, husband of the complainant is 54 years, Chundari Devi-mother-in-law is 77 years and Deoki Devi alleged second wife is aged about 47 years. He submits that considering the fact that the present case is of the year 2009, some sympathetic view may be taken. He also submits that no minimum sentence has been prescribed underSection 494,Section 498-AandSection 323of the Indian Penal Code. 
 7. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party has opposed the prayer and has submitted that the conviction of the petitioners have been done by a well reasoned order and there are consistent findings against the petitioners which do not call for any interference. 
 8. Learned counsel for the complainant has also referred to the finding of the learned trial court and the lower appellate court and submits that through Deoki Devi (2nd wife) there are three children to Mohan Mahto and one of the child of Mohan Mahto and Deoki Devi has also examined before the learned court below. He submits that not only Mohan Mahto solemnized marriage with Deoki Devi but also has three children from her. He also submits that Deoki Devi has been convicted underSection 494of the Indian Penal Code with the aid of section ofSection 109of the Indian Penal Code because of the fact that she very well knew that Mohan Mahto was already married and in spite of that she chose to marry Mohan Mahto. Thus the conviction of the petitioner Deoki Devi with the aid ofSection 109of the Indian Penal Code is fully sustainable in the eyes of law. Learned counsel has also submitted that merely because the Saptpadi has not been4proved and the priest has not been examined the same is not sufficient for interference in this case in view of the fact that there was cogent evidence and to some extent there was admission on the part of the accused that Deoki Devi and Mohan Mahto had undergone marriage and the complainant was the 1st wife of Mohan Mahto. Learned counsel has also referred to para 5 and 6 of the present petition to submit that it is an admitted fact on record that Mohan Mahto had married Deoki Devi. He submits that in such circumstances, the contention of the petitioner that the allegation regarding second marriage is based on no evidence is not correct, rather the finding on this point has been returned by appreciating the materials on record. So far as the point of sentence is concerned, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party has opposed the prayer with regard to Mohan Mahto and Deoki Devi and has not opposed with regard to mother- in-law Chundri Devi who has been given sentence maximum of 6 months. However the period of custody and the age of the petitioners as submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners has not been disputed by the opposite parties. Learned counsel for the opposite party has relied upon a judgment passed by Karnataka High Court in Cr. P.P. No. 1098 of 2009 dated 13.03.2012 to submit that considering this judgment no interference is called for in the present case. 
 9. Arguments are concluded.

 ----------- 
 Reserved on : 08.09.2020 Pronounced on : 14.09.2020 H.C. Mishra, J.:- Heard learned senior counsel for the appellant and learned counsel for the National Investigation Agency (NIA). 
 2. This appeal, preferred underSection 21(4)of the National Investigation Agency Act, 2008, is directed against the order dated 5.01.2019, passed by the learned Judicial Commissioner-cum-Special Judge, NIA, Ranchi, (hereinafter referred to as 'NIA Court'), in Misc. Criminal Application No.1025 of 2018, in connection with Special (NIA) Case No.06 of 2018, RC-21/2018/NIA/DLI, arising out of Dumri (Giridih) P.S. Case No.06 of 2018, whereby the bail application of this appellant has been rejected by the NIA Court. 
 3. According to the NIA's case, the appellant was apprehended on 22.01.2018 while he was going on a motorcycle. The informant Police Officer tried to stop the motorcycle for checking, when this appellant started fleeing away and he was apprehended with the help of the police personnel Cr. Appeal (DB) No.130 of 2019-2-present there. Upon search, rupees six lakhs was recovered from the appellant along with naxal pamphlets and two duel SIM mobile phones. Upon interrogation, the appellant confessed that he used to work for the maoist leader Krishna Da, and he used to collect levy on his behalf. The recovered amount from appellant was also the levy amount, which he had collected on the basis of a letter handed over to him by the said terrorist Krishna Da, which letter was also recovered from the appellant, written on the back side of a nuxal pamphlet. The appellant was taken into custody and police case, being Dumri (Giridih) P.S. Case No.6 of 2018 was instituted against him for the offences underSections 386and120Bof the Indian Penal Code,Sections 13,16,17,20,21and23of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and also under Section 17 of the CLA Act. The charge-sheet was also submitted against the appellant by the police. Subsequently, the investigation was taken up by the NIA. 
 4. Learned senior counsel for the appellant has submitted that the appellant has been falsely implicated in this case. It is submitted that the appellant had also purchased a JCB machine worth Rs.24,000,00/- and odd, and this fact is also being taken against the appellant, but he could account for the money spent in purchasing the said machine. He had no connection with the banned terrorist organization, and he is in custody since the date of his arrest. Learned senior counsel has submitted that the appellant has been falsely implicated in this case and has prayed for bail. 
 5. Learned counsel for the NIA has opposed the prayer and has submitted that during investigation by the NIA, it was found that the transactions of huge amount of money were made from the bank account of the appellant, which were beyond his known income. It was also found that the appellant was only an employee in a construction company, from where he used to get only Rs. 8,000/- per month as salary, and he did not have sufficient means for such transactions of huge amount of money from his bank account. The appellant had also purchased a JCB machine worth Rs.24,000,00/- and odd. The appellant had confessed his guilt and had also confessed to be working for the terrorist group and collecting levy for them. While the appellant was apprehended with the levy amount of rupees six lakhs, one nuxal pamphlet was also recovered from him, on the back side of which it was written ""Priya Comrade Lal Salaam, Aage Sangathan ke saath Cr. Appeal (DB) No.130 of 2019-3-ekraar kia hua rashi, sandesh vahak sathi se bhej denge. BHA. KA. PA. (Maowadi)"". Learned counsel accordingly, submitted that during the investigation, it was found that this appellant was closely linked with the terrorist group and was collecting the levy for them. As such, he cannot be granted bail, asSection 43-D(5) of theUnlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, stands as a bar for granting bail in such cases. Learned counsel for the NIA accordingly, submitted that there is no illegality in the impugned Judgment passed by the NIA Court, rejecting his prayer for bail, and this appeal is fit to be dismissed. 
 6. Having heard learned counsels for both the sides and upon going through the record, we find that the appellant was apprehended with huge amount of money, which is said to be the amount of levy collected by the appellant for the terrorist group. The nexal pamphlet, which was also recovered from the appellant, also supports the fact that he was closely associated with the terrorist organization, and shows that he was authorized by the terrorist organization to collect the money for them. His introduction in the letter for collecting the levy, on the back side of the pamphlet as ""sandesh vahak sathi"", shows that the appellant was in close association with the terrorist organization. As such, at this stage, it cannot be held that the accusation against the appellant is not prima facie true. 
 7.Section 43-D(5) of theUnlawful Activities (Prevention) Actreads as follow:- 
 ""43-D. Modified application of certain provisionsof the Code. - (1) to (4) ------------. 
 (5) Notwithstanding anything contained inthe Code, no person accused of an offence punishable under Chapters IV and VI of this Act shall, if in custody, be released on bail or on his own bond unless the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity of being heard on the application for such release: 
 Provided that such accused person shall not be released on bail or on his own bond if the Court, on a perusal of the case diary or the report made underSection 173of the Code is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against such person is prima face true."" 
 8. A plain reading of this provision clearly shows that if the accusation is found to be prima facie true, Section 43-D(5) of the UA(P) Act, acts as a clear bar for granting bail to the accused. The same view has been Cr. Appeal (DB) No.130 of 2019-4-taken by the Hon'ble Apex Court in National Investigation Agency Vs. Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali, reported in (2019) 5 SCC 1, holding that there is a high burden on the accused in terms of the special provisions contained in Section 43-D(5) of the UA(P) Act to demonstrate that the prosecution has not been able to show that there exist reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against such person is prima face true (Para 47). 
 9. In view of the materials brought before this Court by the NIA, we find that the accusation against the appellant is prima facie true. Learned counsel for the appellant failed to demonstrate before us that the accusation against the appellant may not be prima facie true. As such, in the facts of this case, the appellant is not entitled to the privilege of bail, andSection 43-D(5) of theUnlawful Activities (Prevention) Actis a clear bar in granting the relief, sought for, by the appellant 
 10. Accordingly, we do not find any illegality in the impugned order dated 5.01.2019 passed by the NIA Court, in Misc. Criminal Application No.1025 of 2018, rejecting the prayer for bail of the appellant, worth any interference by this Court. 
 11. There is no merit in this appeal and the same is accordingly, dismissed.

 2. This appeal, preferred underSection 21(4)of the National Investigation Agency Act, 2008, is directed against the order dated 25.11.2019, passed by the learned Judicial Commissioner-cum- Special Judge (NIA), Ranchi, (herein after referred to as the 'NIA Court'), in Misc. Cr. Application No. 1081 of 2019, in connection with Special (NIA) Case No. 03 of 2018, RC-06/2018/NIA/DLI, arising out of Tandwa P.S. Case No. 2 of 2016, whereby the bail application of this appellant was rejected by the NIA Court. 
 3. The case was originally instituted for the offences underSections 414,384,386,387and120-Bof the Indian Penal Code,Sections 25(1-B)(a), 26 & 35 of theArms Actand Section 17(1)(2) of the CLA Act, on the basis of secret information, received by the police, regarding realization / extortion of levy by the banned terrorist organization Tritya Prastuti Committee (for short 'TPC'), in the coal region of Amrapali / Magadh Project of Central Coalfield Ltd., from the contractors, transporters, D.O. holders and coal traders. On such information, the house of one Binod Kumar Ganjhu was raided on 11.1.2016, from where, an amount of Rs. 91,75,890/- and two mobile Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 89 of 2020-2-phones were recovered. Two other persons, viz., Birbal Ganjhu and Munesh Ganjhu were also found there in suspicious condition, and loaded firearms and cartridges were recovered from them. All the three were apprehended by the police, who confessed their proximity with the banned terrorist organization TPC. On the basis of disclosure made by Binod Kumar Ganjhu, the house of the present appellant Pradeep Ram was raided, from where Rs. 57,57,710/- and four cell phones were recovered. Accordingly, Tandwa P.S. Case No. 2 of 2016 was instituted for the aforesaid offences and investigation was taken up. Subsequently, taking into consideration the gravity of the offence, the Central Government, by order dated 13.2.2018, directed the NIA to take over the investigation of the case, andSections 16,17,20and23of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act were also added. 
 4. During investigation by the NIA, the modus operandi of TPC was found that they initially blocked the mining process in Amrapali / Magadh Project areas as a part of conspiracy, they formed the village committees with their own men for starting the process and they imposed levy on coal transportation and realized the levy which used to be distributed amongst the various stake holders. 
 5. Learned senior counsel for the appellant has submitted that the appellant has been falsely implicated in this case and he has sufficient means, as he was engaged in a business of transportation. Learned senior counsel also submitted that considering this fact, the appellant was earlier granted bail by this Court, while the investigation was not taken up by the NIA. Subsequently when the NIA added the offences, under theUnlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the appellant was again taken into custody and was remanded to judicial custody. It is submitted by learned senior counsel, that since he appellant was already on bail for the same occurrence / offence, he ought to have been enlarged on bail. 
 6. Learned senior counsel for the appellant has also submitted that the appellant is innocent and has not committed any offence. It is also submitted that the money recovered from the appellant was the amount relating to his business, the turn over which was more than rupees one crore, even on the date of his arrest. Learned senior counsel has accordingly, submitted that the appellant is entitled to the privilege of bail Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 89 of 2020-3-and impugned order, passed by the NIA Court cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. 
 7. Learned counsel for the NIA, on the other hand, has opposed the prayer and has drawn our attention towards the materials found during the investigation by the NIA against the appellant. It has been found that the appellant had been in close association with the leaders of the terrorist gang and he was also actively involved in the village committee, through which, the levy was being extorted by the terrorist organization. The involvement of the appellant in collecting the levy has also been found and his direct connection with the terrorist organization is established in the investigation made by the NIA, on the basis of the statements of the witnesses recorded by the NIA. Learned counsel has also drawn our attention towards the criminal antecedents of the appellant. It is pointed out by learned counsel for the NIA, that after the appellant was remanded in the case again after addition of the offences under theUnlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the appellant challenged his remand in this Court in W.P.(Cr.) No. 277 of 2018, which was dismissed by this Court. The said order of this Court was also challenged before the Hon'ble Apex Court and his appeal was also dismissed by the Apex Court as well, by order dated 1.7.2019, passed in Criminal Appeal Nos. 816-817 of 2019, holding that the order of remand was correct and not illegal. Learned counsel, accordingly, submitted that the appellant does not deserve the privilege of bail. 
 8. Learned counsel for the NIA further submitted that there is a clear bar in granting bail, underSection 43-D(5) of theUnlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, once the accusation is found to be prima facie true and on this ground also the appellant does not deserve the privilege of bail. As such, there is no illegality in the impugned order passed by the NIA Court, rejecting the bail application of the appellant. 
 9. Having heard learned counsels for both the sides and upon going through the record and also considering the materials produced before us by the NIA, we find that the appellant was apprehended from his house and there was recovery of heavy amount of money from his house. Though the appellant claims this money to be the money related to his business, but there are materials to show that he was involved in terrorist Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 89 of 2020-4-activities and extortion of levy by the terrorist organization. Though, this appellant was granted bail by this Court, but at that time, the offences under theUnlawful Activities (Prevention) Actwere not alleged against him. Subsequently, when the NIA added the offences under theUnlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the appellant was taken into custody and remanded in this case, which action has been upheld up to the Hon'ble Apex Court. As such, it cannot be a case for bail on the ground that the appellant was earlier granted bail by this Court. The materials collected by the NIA during the investigation, show that the accusation against the appellant are prima facie true. 
 10.Section 43-D(5) of theUnlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, reads as follows:- 
 ""43-D. Modified application of certain provisionsof the Code. - (1) to (4) ------------. 
 (5) Notwithstanding anything contained inthe Code, no person accused of an offence punishable under Chapters IV and VI of this Act shall, if in custody, be released on bail or on his own bond unless the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity of being heard on the application for such release: 
 Provided that such accused person shall not be released on bail or on his own bond if the Court, on a perusal of the case diary or the report made underSection 173of the Code is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against such person is prima face true."" 
 11. A plain reading of this provision clearly shows that once the accusation is found to be prima facie true, Section 43-D(5) of the UA(P) Act, acts as a clear bar for granting bail to the accused. The same view has been taken by the Hon'ble Apex Court in National Investigation Agency Vs. Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali, reported in (2019) 5 SCC 1, holding that there is a high burden on the accused in terms of the special provisions contained in Section 43-D(5) of the UA(P) Act to demonstrate that the prosecution has not been able to show that there exist reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against such person is prima face true (Para 47). 
 12. In view of the materials brought before this Court by the NIA, we find that the accusation against the appellant is prima facie true. Learned counsel for the appellant failed to demonstrate before us that the Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 89 of 2020-5-accusation against the appellant may not be prima facie true. As such, in the facts of this case, the appellant is not entitled to the privilege of bail, andSection 43-D(5) of theUnlawful Activities (Prevention) Actis a clear bar in granting the relief, sought for, by the appellant. 
 13. For the foregoing reasons, we do not find any illegality in the impugned order dated 25.11.2019, passed by the NIA Court, in Misc. Cr. Application No. 1081 of 2019, rejecting the bail application of the appellant, worth any interference by this Court. 
 14. There is no merit in this appeal and the same, is accordingly, dismissed.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that petitioner is an illiterate person and he was not knowing that it amounts to misuse of the privilege of bail.

 Order No.02 Dated- 14.09.2020 Heard the parties through video conferencing. Learned counsel for the petitioners personally undertake to remove the defects as pointed out by the stamp reporter within two weeks after the lockdown period is over. 
 In view of the personal undertaking of the learned counsel for the petitioners, the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter are ignored for the present. 
 Apprehending their arrest, the petitioners have moved this Court for grant of privilege of anticipatory bail in connection with Karra P.S. Case No.45 of 2020 registered undersections 414of the Indian Penal Code, Section 54 of J.M.M.C. Rules, 2004 and under Section 3/7 of Jharkhand Mineral (Prevention of Illegal Mining Transportation and Storage) Rule, 2017. 
 The Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the allegation against the petitioners is that the petitioners are the owners of the tractors which were seized by police for transporting illegal excavated sand. It is further submitted that the allegation against the petitioners are all false and they have no knowledge about their vehicle being involved in any illegal activity. It is then submitted that the petitioners are ready and willing to furnish sufficient security including cash security and undertake to cooperate with the investigation of the case. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioners be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. Learned Addl. P.P. opposes the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail. 
 Considering the submissions of the counsels and the fact as discussed above, I am of the opinion that it is a fit case where the above named petitioners be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. Hence, in the event of their arrest or surrender within a period of four weeks from the date of this order, they shall be released on bail on petitioner no.1 depositing cash security of Rs.10,000/- and petitioner no.2 depositing cash security of Rs.5000/- and both of them furnishing bail bond of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned J.M., Khunti, in connection with Karra P.S.

 Defect No. 9 (i), as pointed out by the office, is ignored. The petitioners apprehend their arrest in connection with Mckluskiganj P.S. Case No. 33 of 2019. 
 It has been alleged that the miscreants had committed theft of contract and caterinary wire of 180 meters length and worth Rs.5,00,000/-. It has further been alleged that the accused persons had come to the work site and abused the staffs and threatened that such thefts will be repeated in future. 
 The petitioners appear to be agitating for job and compensation in CCL in view of the acquisition of land. The grievance of the petitioners is that without making payment of compensation and giving service, contract was awarded by the CCL to a private company for construction of a railway siding. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that the matter has been compromised between the parties. 
 In view of the background facts as stated by the learned counsel for the petitioners, their false implication also cannot be ruled out. On consideration of the aforesaid scenario, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioners. 
 Accordingly, the petitioners, named above, are directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, they will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- ( Ten thousand only) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Ranchi in connection with Mckluskiganj P.S.

 So far as the defect nos.3, 4, 9(iv), as pointed out by the office are concerned, learned counsel for the petitioners undertakes to remove the same once the situation normalizes. As regards the rest defects are concerned, same are ignored. 
 The petitioners apprehend their arrest in connection with Protest cum Complaint Case No. 264 of 2019. 
 It has been alleged that one Md Idrish in connivance with other accused persons had fraudulently got executed a sale deed by the complainant for 13 ½ decimals of land. On being confronted, Md Idrish executed an Ekrarnama that after mutation he will execute another sale deed and resale the 13 ½ decimals of land to the complainant. 
 It appears that initially with respect to the allegations, as levelled, Bishnugarh P.S. Case No. 28 of 2018 was lodged, in which after investigation final form was submitted and on a protest petition having been filed by the complainant, cognizance has been taken undersection 420of the Indian Penal Code and the petitioners have been summoned to face the trial. 
 Petitioner Nos. 1 and 3 appear to be the witnesses of the sale deed while petitioner no. 2 is the deed writer of the sale deed. The main allegations even as per the complaint petition seem to revolve around Md. Idrish who was the person mainly responsible for execution of the sale deed by the complainant and the subsequent promise though the said Md. Idrish has resiled in spite of making such promise. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, the petitioners, named above, are directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, they will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- ( Ten thousand only) each with two-2-sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st class, Hazaribagh in connection with Protest cum Complaint Case No. 264 of 2019, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

 So far as the defects, as pointed out by the office are concerned, learned counsel for the petitioners undertakes to remove the same once the situation normalizes. 
 The petitioners apprehend their arrest in connection with Giridih (M) P.S. Case No. 90 of 2020. 
 When the informant had gone to collect woods, she was accosted by the petitioners who tried to outrage her modesty and had also abused and assaulted her. The incident is said to have occurred on 29.03.2020 but the FIR was instituted after a delay of almost ten days without there being any reasonable explanation submitted by the informant regarding such delay. 
 From the FIR, it appears that the primary act alleged against the petitioners is abuse and assault and the allegation about outraging of modesty appears to be by way of an afterthought. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that the matter has been compromised between both the sides. 
 Irrespective of the compromise, which has been effected between the petitioners and the informant party on consideration of the aforesaid facts regarding non explanation of the delay in registration of the F.I.R. and the nature of allegations levelled against the petitioners, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioners. 
 Accordingly, the petitioners, named above, are directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, they will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- ( Ten thousand only) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Giridih in connection with Giridih (M) P.S. Case No. 90 of 2020, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 This application stands allowed.

 Order No. 02: Dated: 14 September, 2020 th Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel appearing for the State. 
 Defect no. 9(i), as pointed out by the office, is ignored. The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Sonari P.S. Case No. 58 of 2019. 
 It has been alleged that the informant and others were fired upon by the accused persons but all had a providential escape. When the locals gathered and started pelting stones the miscreants had fled away. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is not named in the FIR and has subsequently been implicated on account of mis-conception due to a namesake of the petitioner having been alleged to be a participant in the offence. It has been stated that the petitioner is Rohit Das @ Gaurang Das son of Dayamay Das whereas Gaurang Das, who has been mentioned in the FIR, is the son of Sri Prafullo Das. Learned counsel, therefore, submits that save and except the implication of the petitioner on account of the confusion arising out of sharing of name with the other co-accused there is no other material which would indicate the complicity of the petitioner. 
 Learned A.P.P. has opposed the prayer for bail made by the petitionr. 
 From the impugned order it appears that the parentage of the namesake of Gourango Das are different. It further appears that that the said Gourango Das has been named in the FIR and charge sheet has been submitted against him while the investigation is still pending against the present petitioner. The aforesaid facts, therefore, to a certain extent substantiates the contention advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner has been implicated only on account of confusion arising out of a similar sounding name of the petitioner and the named accused in the FIR. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid fact, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. Accordingly, the petitioner, above named, is directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, he will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned J.M.F.C., Jamshedpur at East Singhbhum in connection with Sonari P.S.

 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel appearing for the Directorate of Enforcement. 
 So far as defect no. 4 is concerned, learned counsel for the petitioner undertakes to remove the same once the situation normalizes. As regards rest defects are concerned, the same are ignored. 
 The petitioner apprehends her arrest in connection with ECIR Case No. 02 of 2020. 
 The allegations reveals that M/s Sanjeevani Buildcon through its directors and others had hatched a conspiracy against the gullible investors and cheated them by inducement to purchase plots of land and received a huge amount of money but did not provide possession of the plots to the purchasers and had ultimately closed the office and had fled away. 
 It appears that initially, the CBI had taken over investigation and after submission of charge sheet a case was registered by the Directorate of Enforcement. 
 It has been stated by learned counsel for the petitioner that the present case is an offshoot of Lower Bazar P.S. Case No. 126 of 2012 in which the trial is still going on. Learned counsel submits that it has not been proved that the petitioner is the beneficiary to the proceeds of crime. Learned counsel further submits that the petitioner has remained in custody for more than five years before being granted bail in connection with Lower Bazar P.S. Case No. 126 of 2012 and in such circumstances, therefore, when custodial interrogation is not necessary, the petitioner deserves to be granted anticipatory bail. 
 Countering the said arguments, learned counsel appearing for the Directorate of Enforcement, has referred tosection 45of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and has stated that the petitioner has to show, prima facie, that she is not guilty of the offence of money laundering. It has further been submitted that the present case is separate from that of Lower Bazar P.S. Case No. 126 of 2012. Learned counsel further submits that there are overwhelming materials collected during investigation which would indicate that huge amounts were siphoned off from the various accounts which would show that the same were proceeds of crime. 
 On consideration of the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the respective parties and on going through the investigation report, it appears that the investigation had clearly revealed the modus operandi of the accused persons in cheating the investors in receiving huge amount of money which, prima facie, appears to be the from the proceeds of crime. 
 The case instituted by the Directorate of Enforcement is an altogether different case which is specifically related to the money laundering alleged against the petitioner as she was found to be beneficiary of the proceeds of crime and in such context, therefore, I am not inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner This application, accordingly, stands rejected.

 In view of the personal undertaking of the learned senior counsel for the petitioner, the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter are ignored for the present. 
 Apprehending his arrest, the petitioner has moved this Court for grant of privilege of anticipatory bail in connection with Telaiya P.S. Case No.32 of 2020 (G.R. No. 217 of 2020) registered undersections 302/34of the Indian Penal Code. 
 Heard the learned senior counsel for the petitioner and learned Addl. P.P. for the State. 
 Mr. R.S. Mazumdar, the Learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner draws the attention of this court to the confessional statement of the co-accused-Ratnakar Pandey, and submits that the only allegation against the petitioner is that on being informed by the father of the co-accused Ratnakar Pandey that the sister of Ratnakar Pandey is missing from their house, the petitioner accompanied with co-accused-Ratnakar Pandey to the photo studio of the deceased. It is further submitted by the learned senior advocate that in the confessional statement itself, it is specifically mentioned that after visiting the photo shop of the deceased, the petitioner has not committed any covert or overt act and from the photo shop of the deceased, the co-accused-Ratnakar Pandey followed the deceased in the pillion of the motorcycle driven by Rohit Kumar Singh and assaulted the victim with iron rod resulting in his death. It is next submitted that keeping in view the fact that the petitioner lives in the same locality as the co- accused-Ratnakar Pandey, merely accompanying Ratnakar Pandey to the studio of the deceased in search of the sister of Ratnkar Pandey cannot constitute any common intention with the co- accused persons. It is next submitted that as it has specifically been mentioned that Ratnakar Pandey with Rohit Kumar Singh followed the deceased in a motorcycle for a considerable distance, hence, the petitioner cannot be said to have any knowledge about any criminal intention of the co-accused. It is also submitted by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner that except the call details report there is no material in record to implicate the petitioner in this case and admittedly father of the co-accused called the petitioner over phone so the call details report is of no consequence in the facts of this case. It is, further, submitted that the allegation against the petitioner is false and the charge-sheet has already been submitted against the co-accused person. It is next submitted that petitioner undertakes to cooperate with the investigation of the case. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned Addl. P.P. opposes the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail. 
 Considering the submissions of the counsels and the fact as discussed above, I am of the opinion that it is a fit case where the above named petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. Hence, in the event of his arrest or surrender within a period of four weeks from the date of this order, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned J.M.-1st Class at Koderma, in connection with Telaiya P.S.

 02/14.09.2020 Heard Mr. Gautam Kumar, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Manoj Kr. Mishra, learned A.P.P. for the State. 
 So far as the defects are concerned learned counsel for the petitioner undertakes to remove the same once the situation normalizes. 
 The petitioner has prayed for grant of anticipatory bail, as he is apprehending his arrest in connection with Barharwa P.S. Case No. 492 of 2019, corresponding to G.R. No. 2683 of 2019. 
 The marriage of the informant was solemnized with the petitioner 18 years back. She was kept properly for a period of 5 years. It has been alleged that the petitioner had solemnized another marriage and on a case being filed the matter was compromised and the petitioner agreed to make payment of Rs. 3000/- per month to the informant. It has been alleged that since the last 3 years no maintenance has been paid and the accused persons had tried to burn the informant. 
 The First Information Report appears to be basically revolving around the non-payment of the agreed amount of maintenance. If the allegations are considered with respect to solemnizing a second marriage it seems that the First Information Report has been instituted after an undue delay. If the informant is aggrieved with the non-payment of the agreed amount by the petitioner she has a remedy of-2-approaching the Family Court in a proceeding u/s 125 Cr.P.C. 
 On consideration of the nature of allegations levelled against the petitioner, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petitioner accordingly is directed to surrender before the learned court below within a period of four weeks and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Rajmahal in connection with Barharwa P.S. Case No. 492 of 2019, corresponding to G.R. No. 2683 of 2019, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

 The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with B.S. City P.S. Case No. 122 of 2019. 
 It has been alleged that petitioner had in a drunken state had entered into the Accounts Section and hurled abuses at the informant. It has further been alleged that the home guards present had to forcibly oust the petitioner from the premises. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the petitioner had gone to the office to ventilate his grievance regarding stoppage of salary for two days, which resulted in institution of the First Information Report. He has further submitted that the matter has been compromised between the parties. 
 Learned A.P.P has opposed the prayer for anticipatory bail of the petitioner. The petitioner is a home guard and a plausible explanation has been submitted by the petitioner with respect to the incident which had purportedly occurred in the Accounts Section. Moreover, the matter having been compromised between the parties and the petitioner being a government employee, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. 
 Accordingly, the petitioner, named above, is directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, he will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- ( Ten thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bokaro in connection with B.S. City P.S. Case No. 122 of 2019, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

 So far as defect nos. 3, 4, 5(e) and 9(i) are concerned learned counsel for the petitioner undertakes to remove the same once the situation normalizes. As regards, the rest defects are concerned, the same are ignored. 
 The petitioner has prayed for grant of anticipatory bail, as he is apprehending his arrest in connection with Bank More (Bhuli) P.S. Case No. 326/2019. 
 While the informant and her daughter were going to their house she was assaulted by the accused persons. Her husband was also assaulted and the accused persons had tried to outrage the modesty of her daughter. 
 It appears that the father of the petitioner had also instituted a First Information Report being Bank More (Bhuli) P.S. Case No. 128/2019 against the informant as well as her husband and her daughter. The informant had also instituted Bank More (Bhuli) P.S. Case No. 129/2019 in which the petitioner was granted anticipatory bail by this Court in A.B.A. No. 6995 of 2019. It appears that the petitioner was also treated for the injuries which he had received and in fact the discharge slip of the petitioner which has been brought on record indicates serious injuries having been suffered by the petitioner. So far as the present case is concerned the allegations against the petitioner and others-2-appear to be of assaulting the informant and which are general and omnibus in nature. The previous enmity between the parties is apparent from what has been stated above. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petitioner accordingly is directed to surrender before the learned court below within a period of four weeks and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned C.J.M., Dhanbad in connection with Bank More (Bhuli) P.S.

 In view of the personal undertaking of the learned counsel for the petitioners, the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter are ignored for the present. 
 Apprehending their arrest, the petitioners have moved this Court for grant of privilege of anticipatory bail in connection with Sadar P.S. Case No.168 of 2018 registered undersections 406,420,34of the Indian Penal Code. 
 The Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the allegation against the petitioners is that the petitioners being wife and husband have cheated the informant by taking Rs.8,85,000/- from him to transfer the land but instead of transferring the land they have misappropriated the said money. It is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioners that the allegation against the petitioners is false and the petitioners have not taken any money whatsoever and there is absolutely no document in support of the claim of the informant that the petitioners have taken money from him. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioners be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 The learned counsel for the petitioners seeks permission of this Court to implead informant as opposite party no.2 of this anticipatory bail application. 
 The petitioners are directed to incorporate the name of informant as opposite party no.2 of this anticipatory bail application, within a week after the lockdown period is over. 
 Let notice be issued to the newly impleaded opposite party no.2 under registered cover with A/D as well as under ordinary process for which requisites etc. must be filed within two weeks by the petitioners, failing which, this application shall stand dismissed without further reference to the Bench. 
 The learned Addl. P.P. opposes the prayer for anticipatory bail. 
 List this case on 04.11.2020. 
 Considering the submissions of the counsels and the fact as discussed above, I am inclined to pass an interim order of anticipatory bail provisionally till 04.11.2020. In case of the petitioners being arrested by the police on or before 04.11.2020, they shall be released on bail provisionally on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five thousand) each with two sureties of like amount each to the satisfaction of the officer concerned in connection with Sadar P.S.

 --------- 
 03/14.09.2020 Heard Mr. Pratiush Lala, learned counsel for the petitioners and Mr. Ravi Prakash, learned Spl. P.P. for the State. 
 Since a common prayer has been made in both these applications the same are being disposed of by this common order. 
 The petitioners are accused in connection with Special (NDPS) Case No. 11/2019, arising out of Nirsa P.S. Case No. 179/2019. 
 It has been alleged that 39.300 Kg. of ganja was recovered from a Tavera vehicle. 
 Mr. Pratiush Lala, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that there is no material available on record which would indicate the presence of the petitioners along with the contraband articles in the Tavera vehicle. It has been stated that once the C.I.D. had taken over investigation the statement of one Santosh Kr. Singh was recorded u/s 164Cr.P.C. and the version which he has given does not co-relate with the case. It has also been stated that even if the statement of Santosh Kr. Singh recorded u/s 164Cr.P.C. is taken to be true even than the petitioners cannot be prosecuted since their names are conspicuously absent in the-2-said statement. It has been stated that the petitioners are in custody since 06.06.2020. 
 Mr. Ravi Prakash, learned Spl. P.P. for the State has stated that initially these petitioners along with the other accused persons had got falsely implicated one Chiranjeet Ghosh as being the person who was involved in the transportation of ganja. Subsequently however in course of investigation the innocence of Chiranjeet Ghosh had come to the fore and therefore FRT was submitted in his favour. Learned Spl. P.P. submits that the C.I.D. had taken over the investigation of the case and in course of investigation it was detected from the call records regarding the presence of the petitioners at the place of occurrence. Learned Spl. P.P. further submits that it is these petitioners who are the master minds behind the transportation of contraband articles and in such circumstances these applications deserves to be rejected. 
 On consideration of the arguments advanced by the learned counsels for the parties and on perusal of the case diary it appears that the primary witness of the C.I.D. is Santosh Kr. Singh whose statement was recorded u/s 164Cr.P.C. and who has not named either of these petitioners in his said statement. The implication of the petitioners appear to be on account of their presence found at the place of occurrence through the call records. The counter affidavit which has been filed by the learned Spl. P.P. based on the investigation carried out by the C.I.D. does not appear to contain any concrete material which would indicate that the petitioners were someway concerned with the Tavera vehicle or the ganja which was being transported in the said vehicle. 
 The petitioners have already remained in custody for more than three months and considering the entire facts as narrated above, they are directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) each with two sureties of the like amount each, to the-3-satisfaction of learned Sessions Judge/Special Judge, Dhanbad in connection with Special (NDPS) Case No. 11/2019, arising out of Nirsa P.S.

 02/14.09.2020 Heard Mr. Yogesh Modi, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Anup Pawan Topno, learned A.P.P. for the State as well as Mr. Sanjay Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the opposite party no. 2. 
 So far as defect no. 3 is concerned learned counsel for the petitioner undertakes to remove the same once the situation normalizes. As regards, the rest defects are concerned, the same are ignored. 
 The petitioner has prayed for grant of anticipatory bail, as he is apprehending his arrest in connection with Complaint Case No. 3462/2019. 
 It has been alleged that the complainant was repeatedly molested by the petitioner. 
 The complainant appears to be working as a Store Manager in Lee and Wrangler showroom. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the complainant had defalcated a huge amount from the store and on being confronted had given an undertaking for return of the said amount which on subsequent verification was found to be much higher. It has further been stated that since the amount was not returned a First Information Report was instituted against the complainant being Sadar P.S. Case No. 345/2019 and only in order to save herself and pressurize the owner of the store who happens to be the father of the petitioner not to initiate any criminal proceeding a false case has been lodged alleging molestation by the petitioner. 
 Mr. Sanjay Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the opposite party no. 2 has opposed the prayer for anticipatory bail made by the petitioner and has referred to the complaint petition while submitting that such act was repeated by the petitioner who had taken advantage of being the son of the owner of the store and on being repulsed a false criminal case has been lodged against the informant. 
 It appears that the undertaking given by the complainant has been brought on record and she had undertaken to return back an amount of Rs. 1,40,000/-. However, the defalcated amount was subsequently enhanced on verification to Rs. 14,03,402/-. Since the amount in question was not returned a case was instituted against the complainant being Sadar P.S. Case No. 345/2019 on the same day on which the complainant had lodged the case which is the subject matter of the present application. 
 The background facts, therefore, indicate that the petitioner has given a plausible explanation for his false implication in the present case regard being had to the charges of defalcation which were levelled against the complainant and which also led to institution of a First Information Report. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petitioner accordingly is directed to surrender before the learned court below within a period of four weeks and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned C.J.M., Ranchi in connection with Complaint Case No. 3462/2019, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 This application stands allowed.

It is next submitted that the petitioner has no criminal antecedent as has been mentioned in paragraph no. 15 of the anticipatory bail application. It is then submitted that the petitioner is ready and willing to furnish sufficient security including cash security and undertakes to cooperate with the investigation of the case. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned Addl. P.P. opposes the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail. 
 Considering the submissions of the counsels and the fact as discussed above, I am of the opinion that it is a fit case where the above named petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. Hence, in the event of his arrest or surrender within a period of four weeks from the date of this order, he shall be released on bail on depositing cash security of Rs.5000/- and on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned C.J.M., Dhanbad, in connection with Chirkunda P.S. Case No.42 of 2019 with the condition that the petitioner will cooperate with the investigation of the case and appear before the Investigating Officer as and when noticed by him and will furnish his mobile number and a copy of his Aadhar Card in the court below with the undertaking that he will not change his mobile number during the pendency of the case subject to the conditions laid down under section 438 (2) Cr.

 The petitioners apprehend their arrest in connection with Keredari P.S. Case No. 22 of 2016. 
 It has been alleged that during Ramnavami procession communal disturbance flared up and some shops were looted and burnt. It appears that arising out of the same incident three cases were instituted and in the two cases the accused persons were acquitted. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that some of the accused persons have been acquitted. Learned counsel for the petitioners has stated that the matter has been compromised between the parties. 
 It appears that the allegations are general and omnibus in nature and, in fact, several accused persons, who had faced trial, arising out of separate FIRs instituted out of the same incident have already been acquitted. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid fact, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioners. Accordingly, the petitioners, above named, are directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, they will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand only) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned J.M. 1st Class, Hazaribagh, in connection with Keredari P.S.

 Some dispute had occurred at the time of immersion of Goddess Saraswati. Due to intervention, the matter subsided. However at night, the accused persons variously armed had damaged the household articles of the informant, attacked the womenfolk and when the informant had arrived he was assaulted along with his son and brother. 
 It appears that one Basudeo Gope had also filed a First Information Report which has been registered as Birsa Nagar P.S. Case No. 11 of 2020. The informant had received lacerated wound over right parietal region and another over the occipital region which in terms of the First Information Report is attributed to the petitioners No. 4 and 7.

 The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Kandi P.S. Case No. 43 of 2020. 
 It has been alleged that during Lockdown, a tractor with a trolley which was alleged to be loaded with illegally extracted sand was intercepted. The driver of the tractor was apprehended who disclosed the name of the petitioner who happens to be the owner of the tractor. 
 Mr. Mishra, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that for building purpose the sand was loaded in the tractor from a mining lease area and therefore it cannot be said to be illegally mined sand. It has further been stated that the tractor was entrusted to the driver and therefore any offence committed by the driver would not make the petitioner liable for the same. 
 On consideration of the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner to the effect that the petitioner is the owner of the tractor who was not present at the place of occurrence and since a plausible explanation has been given by the petitioner with respect to the tractor being loaded with sand, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petitioner accordingly is directed to surrender before the learned trial court within four weeks from today and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Garhwa in connection with Kandi P.S.

Cobra Industrial Security Force (I) Ltd. which had submitted its bid was declared L-1 and accordingly work order was issued to it. After completion of one year, the agreement was extended for a further period of one year. It appears that during the period of extension RINPAS had made an advertisement for the same work. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the informant is not competent to institute an F.I.R. under theMines Act,Employees State Insurance Actand Employees Provident Fund andMiscellaneous Provisions Act. Learned counsel submits that the Director of M/s. Cobra Industrial Security Force (I) Ltd. has been granted anticipatory bail by this Court in A.B.A. No. 8801 of 2019.

 The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Dumka (M) P.S. Case No. 99 of 2018 corresponding to G.R. 659 of 2018. 
 It has been alleged that 93 vehicles were found to be illegally loaded with stone chips and sand. Some of the accused persons managed to free all the vehicles from the custody of the informant. 
 The petitioner appears to have been implicated on the re- statement of the informant. It further appears that the persons who had given threatening and who were mainly responsible for getting the vehicles released from the custody of the informant, namely, Ram Pravesh Pandey and Vijay Kumar Tiwary have been granted anticipatory bail by this Court in A.B.A. No. 5036 of 2018 and A.B.A. No. 5474 of 2019.

 Some dispute had occurred at the time of immersion of Goddess Saraswati. Due to intervention, the matter subsided. However at night, the accused persons variously armed had damaged the household articles of the informant, attacked the womenfolk and when the informant had arrived he was assaulted along with his son and brother. 
 It appears that one Ajay Sarkar had suffered punctured as well as lacerated wound in the occipital region which can be attributed to the petitioners No. 2 and 7. In such view of the matter, therefore, I am not inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioners No. 2 and 7. The anticipatory bail application stands rejected as against them. 
 However, as regards petitioners No. 1, 3 to 6 are concerned, in view of the general nature of allegations levelled against them, they are2.directed to surrender before the learned trial court within four weeks from today and on such surrender, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Jamshedpur in connection with Birsa Nagar P.S.

 The appellant has been convicted and sentenced for the offences underSections 364,302,201/34of the Indian Penal Code. 
 Though it is alleged that the victim was abducted and murdered by the accused persons, but the evidence of the eyewitness shows that two other co-accused were carrying the victim on a motorcycle. So far as the murder of the victim is concerned, there is no eyewitness to the occurrence. 
 In similar circumstances, one co-accused namely Pocho Besra @ Budhram Besra @ Fuchu Besra has been granted bail by order dated 03.02.2020 in Cr. Appeal (D.B) No.826 of 2019.

 It has been alleged that the informant was assaulted by the accused persons on the allegation of practicing witch craft. Her silver chain was also snatched. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has been implicated on account of a previous land dispute for which, he has referred to an order passed by the Sub-Divisional Officer, Godda. It has further been stated that the there is no allegation of the informant of being imparted with night-soil and in fact all the family members of the petitioner have been made accused in the present case. 
 Learned A.P.P. has opposed the prayer for anticipatory bail made by the petitioner. 
 It appears that the allegation made in the complaint petition originally instituted does reveal the generality of the same and the petitioner seems to have been implicated for exhorting the other accused persons to commit assault upon the informant. 
 So far as the question of enmity as raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner is concerned, it appears that more than eight years have passed since an order was passed by the Sub-Divisional Officer, Godda and in course of time such enmity, if at all was in existence, must have diminished to a great extent. 
 However, considering the fact that the petitioner is a lady and the nature of allegations levelled against the petitioner, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner.

 Order No. 02: Dated: 14th September, 2020 Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned counsel appearing for the State. 
 Defect no. 9(i), as pointed out by the office, is ignored. The petitioners apprehend their arrest in connection with Kathikund P.S. Case No. 22 of 2020. 
 It has been alleged that some of the accused persons who were on motorcycles loaded with coal were stopped. The accused persons taking advantage of the darkness had fled away and subsequently they were apprehended and the motorcycles loaded with coal were also seized. It further appears that the seizure list was also given to the apprehended accused persons. However, the FIR does not disclose as to whether the petitioners had fled away or not. Nothing has been stated in the FIR. It has been stated in the FIR that the petitioners had violated the lockdown norms. But, in absence of the petitioners being taken into custody in spite of apprehending them and there being nothing to suggest that the petitioners had fled away the allegations itself seems to suffer from grave doubt. 
 In such circumstances, therefore, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioners. Accordingly, the petitioners, above named, are directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, they will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand only) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Dumka, in connection with Kathikund P.S. Case No. 22 of 2020, subject to the conditions as laid down undersection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The lawyer have no objection with regard to the proceeding, which has been held through video conference today at 11.00 A.M. They have no complaint in respect to the audio and video clarity and quality. 
 The petitioner is an accused for allegedly committing an offence punishable underSections 379IPC. 
 Learned A.P.P. opposes the prayer for bail. Petitioner is in custody since 19.01.2019. Charge-sheet has been submitted in this case. This is a case of stealing of motorcycle. 
 Considering the period of custody which is nearly one and half years, I am inclined to allow this application. Accordingly, the petitioner above named is directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Seraikella in connection with Adityapur Police Station Case No. 324 of 2018 (G.R. No. 100 of 2019). 
 I direct the Jail Authority that before releasing the petitioner from jail, the Jail Authority should get the petitioner tested for COVID-19. If the report is positive, then the District Administration will immediately take steps to isolate the petitioner and get him treated in COVID-19 centre by following all the protocols. 
 This direction is given in the larger public interest and it should not be construed as a condition of bail.

 From perusal of order dated 18.12.2013, passed in I.A. No. 1637 of 2013, it appears that in view of judgment passed in Dena Bank's case (AIR 2001 SC 2270), the benefit ofSection 17(B)of the I.D. Act, for which the workman is entitled for, has not been extended rather, the same has arbitrarily been reduced by the Management and as such, in the year 2013 itself, a direction was given by this Court to pay full wages last drawn from the date of award i.e. 24.12.2010 till disposal of the present writ petition and in case respondent No. 3-Radha Mohan Pandey, who is said to have retired, from the date of award till the date of his superannuation.

 The marriage of the daughter of the informant was solemnized with Istak Rain. There was a demand of dowry and on account of non fulfillment of which she was subjected to torture. On 11.01.2020, the informant found her daughter dead. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that the deceased has committed suicide and therefore at best it can be a case undersection 306of IPC. 
 The postmortem report reveals the cause of death as asphyxia due to hanging. The petitioners appear to be inlaws of the deceased.

 C.A.V. on 25/08/2020 Pronounced on:15/09/2020 
 1. Heard, Mr. Anil Kumar Sinha, learned senior counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Anoop Kumar Mehta, learned counsel for the respondent- Coal India Limited. 
 2. This writ petition has been heard through Video Conferencing in view of the guidelines of the High Court taking into account the situation arising due to COVID-19 pandemic. None of the parties have complained about any technical snag of audio-video and with their consent this matter has2been heard. 
 3. The petitioner has preferred this writ petition for quashing the order dated 10.11.2017 contained in Annexure-13 whereby the Disciplinary Authority, in exercise of the power conferred upon the provision of the Rule 27 of Coal India Executive's Conduct, Discipline and Appeal Rules, 1978, penalty of deemed dismissal has been inflicted on the petitioner with effect from 31.07.2013. Further prayer has been made for direction upon the respondents to immediately release the gratuity and leave encashment with interest that has been permanently been withheld by the respondents.. 
 4. It was the case of the petitioner that he was working as Deputy Chief Medical Officer under the respondents and he was superannuated with effect from 31.07.2013. An F.I.R. being R.C. 9(A)/2003(R) was lodged against the petitioner wherein it is alleged that the petitioner while posted as Bhurkunda Dispensary of Barka Sayal Area demanded an illegal gratification of Rs. 500/- and was caught red handed on 07.04.2003 which is still pending in the court of Special Judge, C.B.I, Ranchi. Petitioner was taken into custody on 07.04.2003 and was placed under deemed suspension vide order dated 18.06.2003. The petitioner having being placed under suspension and due to pending initiation of departmental proceeding/framing of charge sheet, the suspension of petitioner was revoked vide order dated 22.10.2003 and the petitioner was directed to resume service with immediate effect. The petitioner was served with memorandum dated 27.12.2004 along with article of charge and a notice to show-cause directing the petitioner to submit his defence in pursuant to article of charges contained within 10 days. Charge is with regard to maintenance of absolute integrity and the petitioner accepted gratification of Rs. 500/- The petitioner violated clause 4.1 (i), 4.1(ii) and 4.1(iii) of Conduct,3Discipline and Appeal Rules, 1978 of CIL which amounts to misconduct in terms of Clause 5.0(2), 5.0(5), 5.0(15) and 5.0(17) of the said rules. Thereafter, departmental proceeding was initiated against the petitioner under Rule 29 of the Coal India Executive's Conduct, Discipline and Appeal Rules, 1978. It was further case of the petitioner that vide order dated 06.04.2005, enquiry was constituted and therefore, the petitioner demanded an opportunity of personal hearing vide his representation dated 06.04.2005. The enquiry officer was appointed vide letter dated 06.04.2005. Three enquiry officers were changed. In the said departmental inquiry, charge was framed in the year, 2004, the inquiry report was submitted in the year, 2012 after lapse of eight years. During pendency of departmental proceeding, the petitioner retired on 31.07.2013. There was no formal order for continuation of departmental proceeding against the petitioner after the retirement of petitioner. Till the retirement of the petitioner, the inquiry report was not provided to the petitioner and therefore, the petitioner vide his representation dated 06.02.2012 demanded the enquiry report from the respondents but the same was not provided to the petitioner. Under the Right toInformation Act, the petitioner moved upto the Central Information Commission for providing inquiry report. That is why, pursuant to order dated 21.06.2017 of the Central Information Commission, instead of providing inquiry report to the petitioner a notice to show cause dated 30.06.2017 was issued to the petitioner. In that show-cause it was stated that due to lack of evidence charge could not be established in departmental proceedings against the petitioner. The petitioner replied to the said show- cause. The Chairman-cum-Managing Director-cum-Disciplinary Authority passed order dated 10.11.2017 whereby in exercise of the power conferred upon the provision of the Rule 27 of Coal India Executive's Conduct,4Discipline and Appeal Rules, 1978, imposed the penalty of deemed dismissal upon the petitioner with effect from 31.07.2013. The petitioner has been honorably acquitted of his criminal charge from criminal proceeding vide judgment dated 11.01.2018 contained in Annexure-14 of the writ petition. The petitioner against the aforesaid order preferred representations dated 30.01.2018 and 01.03.2018. The petitioner has earlier preferred a writ petition being W.P.(S) No. 2400 of 2016 challenging the departmental enquiry but the same was withdrawn by the petitioner which is evident from order dated 11.04.2008 contained in Annexure-16. 
 5. The case of the respondent-Coal India Limited is that the petitioner being aggrieved by order of dismissal has preferred Departmental Appeal under Clause 36.1 of C.D.A, Rules, 1978 on 30.01.2018. The petitioner has filed an application for disbursement of gratuity before the controlling authority under thePayment of Gratuity Act, 1972 which has been allowed and thereafter the appeal has been preferred by the Management which has been allowed by the appellate authority. The said appellate order has not been challenged and the order of the controlling authority has been set-aside. The petitioner while posted and functioning as Medical Superintendent at Bhurkunda Colliery, Barka Sayal Area, CCL was arrested by the CBI, Ranchi on 07.04.2003 for demanding and accepting illegal gratification of Rs, 500/- under thePrevention of Corruption Act. The petitioner was issued a memorandum of major penalty proceeding under Rule 20 of the Conduct, Discipline & Appeal Rules, 1978. Against the said charge, the petitioner submitted his representation. A departmental enquiry was constituted. Subsequently, the said departmental enquiry was modified twice. The Inquiry Authority submitted inquiry report dated 16.07.2012 with a finding that the5charges levelled against the petitioner was not proved. The Disciplinary Authority disagreeing with the findings of the Inquiry Authority issued disagreement memorandum to the petitioner as required under Rule 30.0 of the Conduct, Discipline & Appeal Rules, 1978 giving the petitioner an opportunity for representation. The petitioner submitted his representation on 28.07.2017 against the said disagreement memorandum dated 30.06.2017. The Disciplinary Authority passed order dated 10.11.2017 of deemed dismissal of the petitioner with effect from 31.07.2013. The petitioner is not entitled for payment of EL/HPL encahsment in terms of CIL Executives Leave and also gratuity amount as per thePayment of Gratuity Act, 1972 as the departmental proceeding has ended in deemed dismissal of the petitioner. Even the appellate authority under thePayment of Gratuity Act, 1972 has reversed the order passed by the Controlling Authority directing payment of gratuity already deposited before the Controlling Authority by the respondent-CCL. 
 6. Mr. Anil Kumar Sinha, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner assailed the impugned order on the ground that no termination order can be passed after retirement. He submitted that termination order is prospective whereas effect of that order has been given retrospective which cannot be allowed. In view of the well-settled provision of law, termination order cannot be passed retrospectively. No termination order can be passed after retirement. To substantiate his argument, learned senior counsel for the petitioner relied upon judgement in the case of ""Jaswant Singh Gill v. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd., reported in (2007) 1 SCC 663. The relevant para of the said judgement is quoted here-in-below:- 
 ""7. The short question which arises for consideration in this appeal is as to whether the provisions of the said Act shall prevail over the rules framed by the Coal India6Limited, holding company of Respondent 1, known as the Coal India Executives' Conduct, Discipline and Appeal Rules, 1978 (for short ""the Rules""). Indisputably, the appellant was governed by the Rules. Rule 27 provides for the nature of penalties including ""recovery from pay or gratuity of the whole or part of any pecuniary loss caused to the Company by negligence or breach of orders or trust"". 
 Major penalties prescribed in Rule 27, however, include reduction to a lower grade, compulsory retirement, removal from service and dismissal. Rule 34 provides for special procedure in certain cases stating: 
 ""34.2. Disciplinary proceedings, if instituted while the employee was in service whether before his retirement or during his re-employment shall, after the final retirement of the employee, be deemed to be proceeding and shall be continued and concluded by the authority by which it was commenced in the same manner as if the employee had continued in service. 
 34.3. During the pendency of the disciplinary proceedings, the disciplinary authority may withhold payment of gratuity, for ordering the recovery from gratuity of the whole or part of any pecuniary loss caused to the company, if have been guilty of offences/misconduct as mentioned in sub-section (6) ofSection 4of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 or to have caused pecuniary loss to the company by misconduct or negligence, during his service including service rendered on deputation or on re-employment after retirement. However, the provisions ofSections 7(3)and7(3-A) of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 should be kept in view in the event of delayed payment, in the case the employee is fully exonerated."" 
 .....................................................................7 
 ........................................................................ 
 10. The provisions of the Act, therefore, must prevail over the Rules. Rule 27 of the Rules provides for recovery from gratuity only to the extent of loss caused to the Company by negligence or breach of orders or trust. Penalties, however, must be imposed so long an employee remains in service. Even if a disciplinary proceeding was initiated prior to the attaining of the age of superannuation, in the event the employee retires from service, the question of imposing a major penalty by removal or dismissal from service would not arise. Rule 34.2 no doubt provides for continuation of a disciplinary proceeding despite retirement of employee if the same was initiated before his retirement but the same would not mean that although he was permitted to retire and his services had not been extended for the said purpose, a major penalty in terms of Rule 27 can be imposed. 
 11. Power to withhold penalty (sic gratuity) contained in Rule 34.3 of the Rules must be subject to the provisions of the Act. Gratuity becomes payable as soon as the employee retires. The only condition therefore is rendition of five years' continuous service."". 
 7. The next point submitted by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner was that in the criminal proceeding, the petitioner has been honorably acquitted. He submitted that there is same set of facts in departmental proceeding and criminal proceeding. He submitted that if the employee is honorably acquitted in criminal trial during the pendency of proceeding challenging dismissal, the employee is entitled for benefit. To buttress this point, he relied upon the judgment in the case of ""G.M. Tank v. State of Gujarat"" reported in (2006) 5 SCC 446. 
 
 There is no iota of evidence against the appellant to hold that the appellant is guilty of having illegally accumulated8excess income by way of gratification. The respondent failed to prove the charges levelled against the appellant. It is not in dispute that the appellant being a public servant used to submit his yearly property return relating to his movable and immovable property and the appellant has also submitted his return in the year 1975 showing his entire movable and immovable assets. No query whatsoever was ever raised about the movable and immovable assets of the appellant. In fact, the respondent did not produce any evidence in support of and/or about the alleged charges levelled against the appellant. Likewise, the criminal proceedings were initiated against the appellant for the alleged charges punishable under the provisions of thePC Acton the same set of facts and evidence. It was submitted that the departmental proceedings and the criminal case are based on identical and similar (verbatim) set of facts and evidence. The appellant has been honourably acquitted by the competent court on the same set of facts, evidence and witness and, therefore, the dismissal order based on the same set of facts and evidence on the departmental side is liable to be set aside in the interest of justice. 
 ................................................................................. ................................................................................. 
 30. The judgments relied on by the learned counsel appearing for the respondents are distinguishable on facts and on law. In this case, the departmental proceedings and the criminal case are based on identical and similar set of facts and the charge in a departmental case against the appellant and the charge before the criminal court are one and the same. It is true that the nature of charge in the departmental proceedings and in the criminal case is grave. The nature of the case launched against the appellant on the basis of evidence and material collected against him during enquiry and investigation and as reflected in the charge- sheet, factors mentioned are one and the same. In other9words, charges, evidence, witnesses and circumstances are one and the same. In the present case, criminal and departmental proceedings have already noticed or granted on the same set of facts, namely, raid conducted at the appellant's residence, recovery of articles therefrom. The Investigating Officer Mr V.B. Raval and other departmental witnesses were the only witnesses examined by the enquiry officer who by relying upon their statement came to the conclusion that the charges were established against the appellant. The same witnesses were examined in the criminal case and the criminal court on the examination came to the conclusion that the prosecution has not proved the guilt alleged against the appellant beyond any reasonable doubt and acquitted the appellant by its judicial pronouncement with the finding that the charge has not been proved. It is also to be noticed that the judicial pronouncement was made after a regular trial and on hot contest. Under these circumstances, it would be unjust and unfair and rather oppressive to allow the findings recorded in the departmental proceedings to stand. 
 31. In our opinion, such facts and evidence in the departmental as well as criminal proceedings were the same without there being any iota of difference, the appellant should succeed. The distinction which is usually proved between the departmental and criminal proceedings on the basis of the approach and burden of proof would not be applicable in the instant case. Though the finding recorded in the domestic enquiry was found to be valid by the courts below, when there was an honourable acquittal of the employee during the pendency of the proceedings challenging the dismissal, the same requires to be taken note of and the decision in Paul Anthony case will apply. We, therefore, hold that the appeal filed by the appellant deserves to be allowed. 
 32. In the instant case, the appellant joined the10respondent in the year 1953. He was suspended from service on 8-2-1979 and got subsistence allowance of Rs 700 p.m. i.e. 50% of the salary. On 15-10-1982 dismissal order was passed. The appellant had put in 26 years of service with the respondent i.e. from 1953-1979. The appellant would now superannuate in February 1986. On the basis of the same charges and the evidence, the department passed an order of dismissal on 21-10-1982 whereas the criminal court acquitted him on 30-1-2002. However, as the criminal court acquitted the appellant on 30-1-2002 and until such acquittal, there was no reason or ground to hold the dismissal to be erroneous, any relief monetarily can be only w.e.f. 30-1-2002. But by then, the appellant had retired, therefore, we deem it proper to set aside the order of dismissal without back wages. The appellant would be entitled to pension."" 
 8. On the retrospective point, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner relied upon judgment in the case of ""State Bank of Patiala & Another Vs. Ram Niwas Bansal (Dead) through legal representatives"" reported in (2014) 12 SCC 106. So far as the payment of gratuity is concerned, learned senior counsel for the petitioner relied upon judgement in the case of ""Union Bank of India & Others"" Vs. C.G. Ajay Babu and Another"" reported in (2018) 9 SCC 529. The relevant para of the said judgment is quoted here-in- below:- 
 ""17. Though the learned counsel for the appellant Bank has contended that the conduct of the respondent employee, which leads to the framing of charges in the departmental proceedings involves moral turpitude, we are afraid the contention cannot be appreciated. It is not the conduct of a person involving moral turpitude that is required for forfeiture of gratuity but the conduct or the act should constitute an offence involving moral turpitude. 
 To be an offence, the act should be made punishable under law. That is absolutely in the realm of criminal law. It is not for the Bank to decide whether an offence has been committed. It is for the court. Apart from the disciplinary proceedings initiated by the appellant Bank, the Bank has not set the criminal law in motion either by registering an FIR or by filing a criminal complaint so as to establish that the misconduct leading to dismissal is an offence involving moral turpitude. Under sub-section (6)(b)(ii) of the Act, forfeiture of gratuity is permissible only if the termination of an employee is for any misconduct which constitutes an offence involving moral turpitude, and convicted accordingly by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
 18.In Jaswant Singh Gill v. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd.5, it has been held by this Court that forfeiture of gratuity either wholly or partially is permissible under sub-section (6)(b)(ii) only in the event that the termination is on account of riotous or disorderly conduct or any other act of violence or on account of an act constituting an offence involving moral turpitude when he is convicted. To quote para 13: (SCC p. 670) ""13.The Actprovides for a close-knit scheme providing for payment of gratuity. It is a complete code containing detailed provisions covering the essential provisions of a scheme for a gratuity. It not only creates a right to payment of gratuity but also lays down the principles for quantification thereof as also the conditions on which he may be denied therefrom. As noticed hereinbefore, sub-section (6) ofSection 4of the Act contains a non obstante clause vis-à-vis sub- section (1) thereof. As by reason thereof, an accrued or vested right is sought to be taken away, the conditions laid down thereunder must be fulfilled. The provisions contained therein must, therefore, be scrupulously observed. Clause (a) of sub-section (6) ofSection 4of12the Act speaks of termination of service of an employee for any act, wilful omission or negligence causing any damage. However, the amount liable to be forfeited would be only to the extent of damage or loss caused. The disciplinary authority has not quantified the loss or damage. It was not found that the damage or loss caused to Respondent 1 was more than the amount of gratuity payable to the appellant. Clause (b) of sub- section (6) ofSection 4of the Act also provides for forfeiture of the whole amount of gratuity or part in the event his services had been terminated for his riotous or disorderly conduct or any other act of violence on his part or if he has been convicted for an offence involving moral turpitude. Conditions laid down therein are also not satisfied."" 
 19. In the present case, there is no conviction of the respondent for the misconduct which according to the Bank is an offence involving moral turpitude. Hence, there is no justification for the forfeiture of gratuity on the ground stated in the order dated 20-4-2004 that the ""misconduct proved against you amounts to acts involving moral turpitude"". At the risk of redundancy, we may state that the requirement of the statute is not the proof of misconduct of acts involving moral turpitude but the acts should constitute an offence involving moral turpitude and such offence should be duly established in a court of law. 
 20.That the Actmust prevail over the Rules on Payment of Gratuity framed by the employer is also a settled position as per Jaswant Singh Gill. Therefore, the appellant cannot take recourse to its own Rules, ignoring the Act, for denying gratuity."" 
 
 9. On these grounds, Mr. Anil Kumar Sinha, learned senior counsel for the petitioner submitted that in the departmental proceeding, the petitioner has13been exonerated as the allegation against the petitioner has not been proved. There is no cogent and valid reason passed in differing with the enquiry report of the Disciplinary Authority. Three enquiry officers were changed for concluding the enquiry which was started in the year, 2004 and finally in the year 2012, enquiry report was submitted. The petitioner has been dismissed after retirement which is not valid. 
 10. Per contra, Mr. Anoop Kumar Mehta, learned counsel for the respondent-Coal India Limited submitted that there is provision of appeal under Clause 36.1 of the C.D.A., Rules. The petitioner has preferred appeal and in that view of the matter, the writ petition is fit to be dismissed. Against the order of controlling authority, the respondents preferred appeal under Sub- clause (7) ofSection 7of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 before the Deputy Chief Labour Commissioner (Central), Dhanbad which was allowed and the order of controlling authority has been set-aside. He submitted that the petitioner has nowhere stated that he has challenged the order of appellate authority which is under thePayment of Gratuity Act. He referred to Clause 12.4.2 of the Coal India Executives Leave Rules, 2010 and submitted that earned leave is not eligible to a person who has been terminated on the disciplinary ground. He referred to Clause 12.5 of the Coal India Executives Leave Rules, 2010 (Encashment of Half Pay Leave) and submitted that half pay leave is not permissible to an employee whose service has been terminated pursuant to disciplinary action. By way of referring Rule 34.0 of the Conduct of Coal India Executive Disciplinary and Appeal Rules, 1978, he submitted that special procedure is prescribed for continuation of disciplinary proceeding and in view of Rule 34.2, disciplinary proceeding was allowed to be continued. 
 11. Learned counsel for the respondent-Coal India Limited submitted that14so far as, the judgment in 'Jaswant Singh Gill' (supra) case is concerned, the said judgment has been over-ruled by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Civil Appeal No. 9693 of 2013, in the case of ""Chairman-cum-Managing Director, Mahanadi Coalfields Limited Vs. Rabindranath Choubey"" reported in (2020) SCC Online SC 470. By way of referring page 54 of the writ petition he submitted that along with letter, enquiry report is enclosed and the contention of the learned senior counsel for the petitioner that enquiry report has not been supplied, is not correct. He submitted that reply of enquiry report is contained in Annexure-12. The petitioner was dismissed by a speaking order. He submitted that acquittal in criminal proceeding does not mean to reinstatement in service. Dismissal has taken place earlier and acquittal is after the petitioner has filed appeal as contained in Annexure 15/1, which is still pending. 
 12. By way of reply, learned senior counsel for the petitioner submitted that petitioner is suffering from cancer. He submitted that the order passed by the appellate authority under thePayment of Gratuity Acthas already been challenged in W.P.(S) No. 1063 of 2016. He submitted that no appeal has been filed by Annexure 15/1, it is not in format of appeal rather it is merely representation and appeal lies before the Board of Directors. 
 13. All these aspects advanced by the learned counsel for the parties, the Court has come to its final consideration of the facts and law laid down by the learned counsel for the parties. It is an admitted fact that the enquiry was initiated in the year, 2004 and the enquiry report was submitted in the year, 2012 after eight years under letter dated 30.06.2017 contained in Annexure-11 which is under the signature of Chairman-cum-Managing Director- Disciplinary Authority. That enquiry authority has submitted report on 10.07.2012 finding that due to lack of evidence, charge could not be15established and it has been observed in the said letter that there was no evidence for demanding illegal gratification of Rs. 500/- as recovered from the petitioner. From this letter, which is document issued by the Disciplinary Authority pursuant to representation of the petitioner. Enquiry report shows as stated in letter that the petitioner has been exonerated by the enquiry officer. The petitioner has also been acquitted in the criminal case by the competent Court as prosecution has not been able to establish charge levelled against the petitioner underSection 7,13(2) r/wSection 13(1) (d) of thePrevention of Corruption Act. It is not in dispute that the petitioner has been acquitted from the charges in criminal case as well as before the enquiry officer. In the departmental proceeding and criminal case there is identical and similar set of facts and evidence. The charges in the departmental proceeding and before the criminal court are one and the same, where in both the proceeding, the petitioner has been acquitted. There is no iota of difference in criminal proceeding and departmental proceeding. From the rules and regulations adopted for punishment of the petitioner, it appears to be pre-occupied mind of the disciplinary authority. This is not a case of a person who has been acquitted in criminal case and held guilty in departmental proceeding. In both the proceeding, the petitioner has been exonerated. The order of termination is prospective in nature however, it has been given effect to retrospective. 
 14. On query from the Court, Mr. Mehta submitted that appeal lies before the Board of Directors and Board of Directors meeting is being held after interval of three to four months. On perusing the Annexure15/1, it transpires that this is not an appeal before the Board rather it is a representation. Order passed by the appellate authority under thePayment of Gratuity Actis the subject matter in W.P.(S) No. 1063 of 2016. Thus, objection16of the learned counsel of Coal India is not sustainable. On these premises as discussed here-in-above, sufficient ground of interference is made out by this Court. 
 15. In the case of Chairman-cum-Managing Director, Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court at para 62 overruled the decision in 'Jaswant Singh Gill' (supra). In this judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court came to the conclusion that dismissal from service are not open to be inflicted on conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings. The relevant paragraph are reproduced here-in-below: 
 ""73.Under the circumstances, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court cannot be sustained and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside and is accordingly hereby quashed and set aside and the order passed by the Controlling Authority is hereby restored. However, the appellant-employer is hereby directed to conclude the disciplinary proceedings at the earliest and within a period of four months from today and pass appropriate order in accordance with law and on merits and thereafter necessary consequences as perSection 4of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, more particularly Sub-section (6) ofSection 4of the Gratuity Act and Rule 34.3 of the CDA Rules shall follow. The present appeal is accordingly allowed. However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs."" 
 16. While concurring with judgment of Hon'ble Mr. Justice M.R. Shah, Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ajay Rastogi added as : 
 ""101. To sum up, my conclusion to the question is as under:-- Que. 1-Whether it is permissible in law for the employer to withhold the payment of gratuity even after the employee has attained his superannuation from service because of the pendency of disciplinary proceedings against him? 
 Ans. I am in agreement with the view expressed by brother Justice Shah that in view of Rule 34.3 of the Rules, 1978, the employer has a right to withhold gratuity during pendency of the disciplinary proceedings. 
 Que. 2- Whether the penalty of dismissal could be imposed after the employee stood retired from service? 
 Ans. In my considered view, after conclusion of the disciplinary inquiry, if held guilty, indeed a penalty can be inflicted upon an employee/delinquent who stood retired from service and what should be the nature of penalty is always depend on the relevant scheme of Rules and on the facts and circumstances of each case, but either of the substantive penalties specified under Rule 27 of the Rules, 1978 including dismissal from service are not open to be inflicted on conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings and the punishment of forfeiture of gratuity commensurate with the nature of guilt may be inflicted upon a delinquent employee provided under Rule 34.3 of Rules, 1978 read with sub- section (6) ofSection 4of the Act, 1972. 
 102.To conclude, the impugned judgment of the High Court th dated 17 July, 2013 is not sustainable and deserves to be set aside and the disciplinary authority may proceed and conclude the pending disciplinary proceedings expeditiously and take a final decision in accordance with the scheme of Rules, 1978 read with sub-section (6) ofSection 4of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972."" 
 17. In the above case it has been held that dismissal from services are not open to be inflicted on conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings. In present case the petitioner has been exonerated in disciplinary proceedings and in criminal case he has been acquitted. Thus, charges against the petitioner are not framed. To remit back the matter will be a futile exercise as in departmental proceedings and in criminal proceedings the petitioner has been exonerated. 
 18. As a cumulative effect of above discussions and in view of the18sufficient materials available on record, the writ petition succeeds. Accordingly, the impugned penalty of deemed dismissal of the petitioner dated 10.11.2017 is quashed. Consequently, the petitioner will be entitled for leave encashment with interest. So far payment of gratuity is concerned that will depend on the outcome of W.P.(S) No. 1063 of 2016 in which petitioner has challenged the order of appellate authority passed under thePayment of Gratuity Act. The petitioner has already chosen a remedy under the statutory provision of that Act, thus, the Court is restrained to pass any order on the point of gratuity. 
 19. The writ petition stands allowed and disposed of. Pending I.A., if any, stands disposed of.

 CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANJAY KUMAR DWIVEDI 
 ----- 
 1. Heard, Mr. Kumar Harsh, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. A.K. Das, assisted by Ms. Swati Shalini, learned counsel for the respondent- CCL. 
 2. This writ petition has been heard through Video Conferencing in view of the guidelines of the High Court taking into account the situation arising due to COVID-19 pandemic. None of the parties have complained about any technical snag of audio-video and with their consent this matter has been heard. 
 3. The petitioner has preferred this writ petition for quashing the order dated 22.06.2018 whereby the petitioner has been dismissed from service w.e.f. 10.03.2018. Further, prayer has been made for direction upon the respondents that the disciplinary proceeding initiated vide chargesheet2contained in memo no. 2162 dated 13.12.2017 stands abated in view of the status that the petitioner has superannuated from service w.e.f. 31.03.2018. Further prayer has been made for making payment of retiral benefits and consequential and terminal benefits. 
 4. It was the case of the petitioner that he was appointed on the post of Dumper Operator, Category-I on 02.04.1979 and the petitioner has been discharging his duty satisfactorily. The petitioner was served with a notice for retirement under superannuation from the management vide notice dated 16.10.2017, whereby it was decided that the petitioner will retire from the service of the respondent company w.e.f. 31.03.2018. A chargesheet dated 13.12.2017 was drawn against the petitioner vide Memo No. 2162 dated 13.12.2017 whereby the petitioner has been asked to show cause as to why the petitioner should not be dismissed from his service on the allegation that the petitioner has impersonated to be the son-in-law of one Dinu, Ex-employee, Kargil Washery, CCL, Bokaro. The petitioner submitted his reply to the said show-cause denying the allegation. The enquiry was initiated against the petitioner and charge has been framed against the petitioner. Enquiry was concluded. Second-show cause along with enquiry report was handed over to the petitioner vide show-cause notice dated 16.03.2018. In the enquiry report the petitioner was found guilty. The petitioner replied to the second show-cause denying all the charges levelled against him. The petitioner has earlier filed W.P.(S) No. 381 of 2018 for quashing the chargesheet issued against the petitioner on the ground that punishment of dismissal was indicated in the charge-sheet itself. Finally, the petitioner withdrew the said writ petition. The petitioner was superannuated w.e.f. 31.03.2018. Against the dismissal order dated 22.06.2018, the petitioner has preferred this writ petition.3 
 5. The case of the respondent-CCL is that the finding recorded by the enquiry officer and the appellate authority are correct and there is no infirmity. The petitioner has been found guilty in the departmental proceeding. The petitioner was appointed as Dumper Operator in the respondent-CCL on 02.04.1979 and his date of birth recorded in his service was recorded as 05.03.1958. On completion of 60 years of his age on 04.03.2018, the petitioner retired on 31.03.2018 for which a superannuation notice dated 16/20.10.2017 has been issued to him. A complaint has been received from one Sri Ajay Ghasi, social worker alleging therein that the petitioner along with other has secured employment in C.C.L. fraudulently placing himself as forged son-in- law, son, brother of Harizan Adiwasi whereas they are of upper caste. The complaint was also forwarded by the Coal India Limited by a letter dated 12.09.2016. A preliminary enquiry has been conducted in which report was submitted on 11.11.2017 whereby it was found that in consistence in declaration in the native address by the petitioner gives rise to serious doubt and the identity of petitioner is serious. Accordingly, charge-sheet was issued to the effect that the petitioner obtained employment at CCL fraudulently becoming forged son-in-law of Sri Dinu, Ex-employee, Kargali Washery, B & K Area. As per service book and other documents i.e. L.T.C option form and CCEBFS Nomination Form the permanent address recorded as village - Chalkari, District-Giridih, whereas permanent address recorded in Gratuity Nomination Form was village-Maniamdih, P.O. and P.S. Navinagar, District- Aurangabad, State-Bihar. During preliminary enquiry the petitioner has stated his permanent address as village-Maniamdih, P.O. and P.S. Navinagar, District- Aurangabad, State-Bihar and his in-laws address village- Chalkari Basti, P.O. Petarwar, District-Bokaro. The petitioner was not the son-in-law of the said ex-4employee. On being found that the reply of chargesheet is not satisfactory, a departmental enquiry has been ordered to be proceeded against the petitioner. It was further case of the respondent-CCL that the petitioner all along participated in the enquiry without any demur. During course of enquiry proceeding dated 08.01.2018, a question was raised to the petitioner about his schooling at question no. 38, in turn the petitioner replied that he had got education from Dhori Middle School which was enquired from the Principal, Dhori Middle School whereby the Principal, Middle School, Dhori School vide letter dated 01.02.2018 informed that the name of the petitioner has not been entered in the register. The petitioner got stay order in the W.P.(S) No. 381 of 2018 whereby the Court directed the respondents that final order in the departmental proceeding shall not be passed. The Enquiry Officer submitted his report on 10.03.2018 holding the charges proved levelled against the petitioner. A second show-cause was issued against the petitioner. The respondent-CCL filed an interlocutory application in W.P.(S). No. 381 of 2018 for vacating the stay order dated 14.02.2018 annexing therein the enquiry report, second show-cause notice and reply of the petitioner to the second show-cause notice and also bringing the fact that the petitioner is going to retire w.e.f. 31.03.2018. The petitioner withdrew the said writ petition. In view of the fact that as the petitioner has obtained stay order for passing no order in the departmental proceeding and that is why the impugned order has been passed after superannuation of the petitioner. 
 6. At the outset, the Court asked the learned counsel for the petitioner to avail alternative remedy by way of raising industrial dispute under theIndustrial Disputes Actbut the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the writ petition may kindly be decided on merit. Thus, the arguments of the5learned counsel for the parties have been advanced. 
 7. Mr. Kumar Harsh, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner assailed the impugned order on the ground that the service of the petitioner has been terminated retrospectively by order dated 22.06.2018 w.e.f. 10.03.2018. He submitted that the charge-sheet dated 13.12.2017 has been issued pre-determined. The charge drawn against the petitioner is false and frivolous. The petitioner was not supplied document in the enquiry proceeding. The dismissal order is pre-determined. The enquiry report is based on surmises and conjectures. He referred Annexure-5 and submitted that by way of this document, it appears that service record is not available. He further referred Annexure-6 which is letter of the B.D.O., Petarwar and submitted that the B.D.O. has sought the full name and father's name for completing enquiry. He submitted that the petitioner has been terminated retrospectively. To substantiate his argument he relied upon judgment in the case of ""Bhagirathi Jena Vs. Board of Directors, O.S.F.C. & Ors"", reported in (1999) 3 SCC 666. The relevant para of the said judgment is quoted here-in-below:- 
 ""6.It will be noticed from the abovesaid regulations that no specific provision was made for deducting any amount from the provident fund consequent to any misconduct determined in the departmental enquiry nor was any provision made for continuance of the departmental enquiry after superannuation. 
 7. In view of the absence of such a provision in the abovesaid regulations, it must be held that the Corporation had no legal authority to make any reduction in the retiral benefits of the appellant. There is also no provision for conducting a disciplinary enquiry after retirement of the appellant and nor any provision stating that in case misconduct is established, a deduction could be made from retiral benefits. Once the6appellant had retired from service on 30.06.1995, there was no authority vested in the Corporation for continuing the departmental enquiry even for the purpose of imposing any reduction in the retiral benefits payable to the appellant. In the absence of such an authority, it must be held that the enquiry had lapsed and the appellant was entitled to full retiral benefits on retirement."" 
 8. Learned counsel for the petitioner further relied on judgment in the case of ""Chairman-cum-Managing Director, Mahanadi Coalfields Limited"" reported in (2020) SCC Online SC 470 and submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that retrospective termination is not allowed. 
 9. Per contra, Mr. A.K. Das, learned counsel for the respondent-C.C.L. submitted that the petitioner has fraudulently obtained employment which has been found on through enquiry. The petitioner has been given full opportunity to defend himself in the departmental proceeding. The second show-cause has been issued along with enquiry report. Pursuant to reply, which has not been found to be satisfactory, the impugned order has been passed. He submitted that in view of W.P.(S) No. 381 of 2018, wherein charge-sheet was challenged by the petitioner, it appears that respondent-CCL was restrained from passing any order and in that view of the matter the respondents have not been able to pass any order. He further submitted that finally the petitioner simply withdrew the said writ petition thereafter, the impugned order has been passed. He submitted that due to act of the petitioner, the impugned order has not been passed before his termination. On the one hand at his instance, final order was not passed in the departmental proceeding and on the other hand he withdrew the writ petition. 
 10. He submitted that the petitioner has fraudulently obtained7employment which cannot be said to be a person holding a post. He submitted that the appointment of the petitioner was void and non est. To substantiate his argument, he relied on judgment in the case of ""R. Vishwanatha Pillai Vs. State of Kerala & Others"" reported in (2004) 2 SCC 105. The relevant para of the said judgment is quoted here-in-below:- 
 
 ""15. This apart, the appellant obtained the appointment in the service on the basis that he belonged to a Scheduled Caste community. When it was found by the Scrutiny Committee that he did not belong to the Scheduled Caste community, then the very basis of his appointment was taken away. His appointment was no appointment in the eye of the law. He cannot claim a right to the post as he had usurped the post meant for a reserved candidate by playing a fraud and producing a false caste certificate. Unless the appellant can lay a claim to the post on the basis of his appointment he cannot claim the constitutional guarantee given underArticle 311of the Constitution. 
 
 As he had obtained the appointment on the basis of a false caste certificate he cannot be considered to be a person who holds a post within the meaning ofArticle 311of the Constitution of India. Finding recorded by the Scrutiny Committee that the appellant got the appointment on the basis of a false caste certificate has become final. The position, therefore, is that the appellant has usurped the post which should have gone to a member of the Scheduled Castes. In view of the finding recorded by the Scrutiny Committee and upheld up to this Court, he has disqualified himself to hold the post. The appointment was void from its inception. It cannot be said that the said void appointment would enable the appellant to claim that he was holding a civil post within the meaning ofArticle 311of the8Constitution of India. As the appellant had obtained the appointment by playing a fraud, he cannot be allowed to take advantage of his own fraud in entering the service and claim that he was holder of the post entitled to be dealt with in terms ofArticle 311of the Constitution of India or the Rules framed thereunder. Where an appointment in a service has been acquired by practising fraud or deceit, such an appointment is no appointment in law, in service and in such a situationArticle 311of the Constitution is not attracted at all. 
 ......................................................................... 
 19. It was then contended by Shri Ranjit Kumar, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant that since the appellant has rendered about 27 years of service, the order of dismissal be substituted by an order of compulsory retirement or removal from service to protect the pensionary benefits of the appellant. We do not find any substance in this submission as well. The rights to salary, pension and other service benefits are entirely statutory in nature in public service. The appellant obtained the appointment against a post meant for a reserved candidate by producing a false caste certificate and by playing a fraud. His appointment to the post was void and non est in the eye of the law. The right to salary or pension after retirement flows from a valid and legal appointment. The consequential right of pension and monetary benefits can be given only if the appointment was valid and legal. Such benefits cannot be given in a case where the appointment was found to have been obtained fraudulently and rested on a false caste certificate. A person who entered the service by producing a false caste certificate and obtained9appointment for the post meant for a Scheduled Caste, thus depriving a genuine Scheduled Caste candidate of appointment to that post, does not deserve any sympathy or indulgence of this Court. A person who seeks equity must come with clean hands. He, who comes to the court with false claims, cannot plead equity nor would the court be justified to exercise equity jurisdiction in his favour. A person who seeks equity must act in a fair and equitable manner. Equity jurisdiction cannot be exercised in the case of a person who got the appointment on the basis of a false caste certificate by playing a fraud. No sympathy and equitable consideration can come to his rescue. We are of the view that equity or compassion cannot be allowed to bend the arms of law in a case where an individual acquired a status by practising fraud. 
 11. Learned counsel for the respondent-CCL further submitted that equity or compassion cannot be allowed to bend the arms in a case where an individual acquired status by practicing fraud and to substantiate this argument, he relied on judgment in the case of ""Bank of India & Another Vs. Avinash D. Mandivikar and Others"" reported in (2005) 7 SCC 690. The relevant para of the said judgment is quoted here-in-below: 
 
 ""8. Notice contemplated in para 6 should be issued to the parents/guardian also in case candidate is minor to appear before the Committee with all evidence in his or their support of the claim for the social status certificates. 
 9. The inquiry should be completed as expeditiously as possible preferably by day-to-day proceedings within such period not exceeding two months. If after inquiry, the Caste Scrutiny Committee finds the claim to be false or spurious, they should pass an order cancelling10the certificate issued and confiscate the same. It should communicate within one month from the date of the conclusion of the proceedings the result of enquiry to the parent/guardian and the applicant."" 
 12. Learned counsel for the respondent-CCL further relied on judgment in the case of ""Abdul Rajjak VS. Central Coalfields Ltd. & Ors"" passed in W.P.(S) No. 3064 of 2013 and submitted that in the case of fraudulent appointment that writ petition has been dismissed. He submitted that in that case the issue was same out of same respondent. 
 13. The Court has proceeded to examine the contention of the learned counsel for the parties. It is an admitted fact that departmental proceeding was initiated before the superannuation of the petitioner. At the instance of the petitioner, the respondents were restrained to pass any order after conclusion of departmental proceeding. The respondent-CCL filed an interlocutory application in W.P.(S) No. 381 of 2018 for vacating the stay thereafter, the petitioner simply withdrew the said writ petition. Thereafter, impugned order has been passed. Thus, at the instance of the petitioner the respondent-CCL was restrained to pass any order. Moreover, the petitioner has not contended his case in W.P.(S) No. 381 of 2018 and not contended the said writ petition to its logical end. Thus, the respondents were restrained by the Court to pass final order. Pursuant to departmental proceeding, the petitioner has been allowed to participate in the departmental proceeding wherein he has been provided full opportunity of hearing. The petitioner has also been served show-cause notice and second show-cause notice in the enquiry and has been found guilty. The degree of departmental proceeding is pre-ponderance of probabilities and not the proof beyond reasonable doubt. The petitioner has obtained the appointment by way of playing fraud. 
 
 14. The question herein is that as to whether the High Court underArticle 226of the Constitution of India can interfere with the impugned order of imposition of penalty by the disciplinary authority or not. The said issue has been elaborately dealt with by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of ""Management of State Bank of India Vs. Smita Sharad Deshmukh and Another."" reported in (2017) 4 SCC 75. The relevant para of the said judgment is quoted here-in-below:- 
 
 ""5. It is a well-settled principle that the High Court will not reappreciate the evidence but will only see whether there is evidence in support of the impugned conclusion. The court has to take the evidence as it stands and its only limited jurisdiction is to examine, whether on the evidence, the conclusion could have been arrived at. (See Union of India v. H.C. Goel.) 
 6.In Bank of India v. Degala Suryanarayana, after referring to H.C. Goel case, this Court held at para 11: (Degala case, SCC pp. 768-69) ""11. Strict rules of evidence are not applicable to departmental enquiry proceedings. The only requirement of law is that the allegation against the delinquent officer must be established by such evidence acting upon which a reasonable person acting reasonably and with objectivity may arrive at a finding upholding the gravamen of the charge against the delinquent officer. Mere conjecture or surmises cannot sustain the finding of guilt even in departmental enquiry proceedings. The court exercising the jurisdiction of judicial review would not interfere with the findings of fact arrived at in the departmental enquiry proceedings excepting in a case of mala fides or perversity i.e. where there is no12evidence to support a finding or where a finding is such that no man acting reasonably and with objectivity could have arrived at that finding. The court cannot embark upon reappreciating the evidence or weighing the same like an appellate authority. So long as there is some evidence to support the conclusion arrived at by the departmental authority, the same has to be sustained."" 
 15. The judgment relied by the learned counsel for the petitioner in ""Chairman-cum-Managing Director, Mahanadi Coalfields Limited"" (supra), in that case the Hon'ble Supreme Court considered Rule 34 of the Conduct, Discipline & Appeal Rules, 1978 and came to the finding that Rule 34 of the CDA Rules provides for special procedure in certain cases which permits continuation of disciplinary proceeding even after final retirement of any employee and disciplinary proceedings are instituted while the employee was in service whether before his retirement or during his re-employment. The Court found that Rule 34 of C.D.A. Rules provides continuation of departmental proceeding even after retirement of any employee. This was subject matter before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of ""Chairman- cum-Managing Director, Mahanadi Coalfields Limited"" (supra) and fraud aspect was not subject matter in that case. In that case the Hon'ble Supreme Court directed the disciplinary authority to proceed and conclude the disciplinary proceeding pending expeditiously and take final decision in accordance with scheme's 1978 read with sub-section (6) of thePayment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in this case directed to conclude the departmental proceedings. Thus, the said judgment relied by the learned counsel for the petitioner is not helping the petitioner. 
 16. The case of ""Bhagirathi Jena"" (supra) relied by the learned counsel13for the petitioner was considered on the basis of provision of exigency in the Orissa Financial State Corporation Staff Regulation, 1975. In that case the Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the regulation of Orissa Financial State Corporation Staff Regulation, 1975 and found that there is no provision of reduction in the retiral benefits and there is no provision of conducting disciplinary enquiry after retirement. In that case fraud aspect for obtaining employment was also not the subject matter before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Thus, the said judgment is not helping the petitioner. 
 17. The judgment relied by Mr. A.K. Das, learned counsel for the respondent-CCL in 'R. Viswanatha Pillai Vs. State of Kerala & Others', 'Bank of India & Another Vs. Avinash D. Mandivikar & Others' and 'Abdul Rajak' (supra) are applicable in the facts and circumstances the present case. No sympathy and equitable consideration can come to rescue to the petitioner. Equity or Compassion cannot be allowed to bend arms of law in a case where an individual acquired status by practicing fraud. 
 18. As a cumulative effect of the discussions made above and the law laid-down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, no relief can be extended to the petitioner. Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed. Pending I.A., if any, stands disposed of.

Case No.39 of 2019 has been registered by two persons Bipin Singh and Praveen Kumar underSections 420,406,120BIPC andSection 138of the Negotiable Instruments Act, as it is alleged in the First Information Report that Bipin Kumar has purchased land of Mauza- Bandhgora, having Thana No.35, Khata No.28 and Plot No.15 of an area of 6 decimals under Chas Circle in the District of Bokaro vide Registered Deed No.4241 dated 26.07.2014 and Praveen Kumar has also purchased land of 6 decimals of said part of the plot adjacent to Plot of said Bipin Kumar vide Registered Deed No.4240 dated 26.07.2014. Subsequently they have also paid Rs.80,000/- for mutation and for construction of boundary wall upon the said land which has not been done. 
 7. Learned Senior counsel for the petitioner has further submitted that the petitioner has never sold any land of the Government or protected forest area rather the land which has been sold by the petitioner is on the basis of Power of Attorney issued by the owner of of the land, as such, the land belongs to a private party, namely, Ajay Mahatha and others who have never filed any complaint against the petitioner and petitioner has been wrongly implicated in this case and is in custody, as such, he may be enlarged on regular bail. 
 8. Mr. Shekhar Sinha, learned counsel for the State has opposed the prayer for bail and in support of his submission has referred at para 42 of the case diary where the statement of the Circle Officer, Chas has been recorded, who has categorically stated that Mauza- Bandhgora, having Thana No.35, Khata No.28 and Plot No.15 of an area of 6 decimals under Chas Circle which has been sold to Bipin Kumar is protected forest area, as such, he has prayed to reject the same. 
 9. Mr. Mahesh Tewari, learned counsel for the informant has also opposed the prayer for bail and submitted that he has filed a detail counter-affidavit along with the annexures. 
 10. Learned counsel for the informant in support of his submission has relied upon the statements made from Paras-4 to 15 of the counter-affidavit, which are as follows: 
 ""4. That to gain confidence of the deponent, the petitioner showed them a Mukatarnama namely 4-127 dated 28.01.2011. Believing upon him, the deponent made payment of-3-Rs.3,00,000/- and on 26.07.2014, the sale deed no.4241 was executed in the name of deponent. Thereafter, Rs. 12 Lakhs was also paid by the co-informant Praveen Kumar for which sale deed no.4240 dated 26.07.2014 was executed by the petitioner. 
 Thereafter, on being pressurized to get the mutation done in their respective names construct the boundary and thereby give the physical possession of the land. The petitioner again took Rs. 80,000/- from the deponent and another Rs.80,000/- from the co-informant Praveen Kumar. 
 5. That, he did not give any mutation papers or rent receipts or construct the boundary wall over the land but gave a forged and fabricated mutations, papers and rent receipts in the name of Praveen Kumar. At no point of time had he constructed the boundary wall, nor gave the physical possession to the informant and co-informant Praveen Kumar. 
 6. That, in the year 2016, the deponent came to know through the newspaper that Chandradeep Kumar had sold forest land by stating the same to be raiyati land to many persons of the town for which he had also gone to jail. On this deponent, tried to meet Chandradeep Kumar but without any success. 
 7. That in the year 2016 itself, the deponent came to know that the State Govt. of Jharkhand on the ground of selling of forest land by the petitioner got a case registered as against the petitioner being Sector-12 P.S. Case No.50 of 2016 in which the land given to the present deponent was also included. 
 8. That finally the deponent and co-informant were successful in meeting the petitioner on 16.12.2018 on which he gave a cheque of Rs.3 Lakh to the deponent to be encashed from Canara Bank, Bank being cheque No.556602 dated 11.2.2019. Similarly one cheque of Rs.12 Lakhs was also given to Praveen Kumar of Canara bank being cheque no.556603 dated 15/3/2019 with a condition that after the cheques are encashed, the lands registered in the name of deponent and the co- informant Praveen Kumar shall be revoked and the land according to the requirement shall return to the petitioner. 
 9. That on presentation of the said cheque by the deponent, the same was dishonoured because of the insufficient fund. 
 10. That similarly the cheque given to Praveen Kumar was also dishonoured because of signature were different. As such, it was crystal clear that the deponent had been cheated of an amount of Rs. 3,80,000/- where as other co-informant namely Praveen Kumar had been cheated of an amount of Rs. 
 12,80,000/- in this way a case undersection 406,420,120B IPC was registered as against Chandradeep Kumar. 
 11. That, absolute sale deed in favour of the deponent is on the basis of power of attorney given by Sri Ajit Kumar Mahtha and three others dated 28.01.2011 by the registered book IV- 1 to 7 in favour of the petitioner wherein the area given to the deponent was 6 decimal and to co-informant Praveen Kumar, the area was also 6 decimal. 
 12. That the power of attorney given to the petitioner was for 60 decimal only out of area of 14.60 acre. 
 13. That co-informant Praveen Kumar paid Rs. 12 Lakh from his account of Axis bank. 
 14. That however, on further enquiry, the deponent came to know that Bandgora under Chas thana, Thana No. 35, Plot No. 15 was a complete protected forest and could neither be sold or purchased, but knowing this aspect of the matter, the same was sold to the deponent and co-informant Praveen Kumar. 
 15. That the petitioner had sold the land to the deponent and co-informant Praveen Kumar on the basis of general power of attorney vide Attorney No. 127 dated 28.01.2011 and in the-4-said power of attorney raiyat of Khata No. 287, Plot No. 15 of Bandgora Mouza given him a power of 60 decimal of land but the petitioner had registered the total 458 decimal of land against the said power from 2011 to 2017."" 
 11. Learned counsel for the informant has further relied upon Annexure-E of the counter-affidavit at Page No.29 wherein item No.15, which relates to Mauza- Bandhgora and has been declared as protected forest area and has prayed that this Court may not enlarge the petitioner on bail as this petitioner has several criminal antecedents including FIR of Sector 12 (Bokaro) P.S. Case No.50 of 2016. 
 12. Learned counsel for the informant has further submitted that he got information that Government of Jharkhand has already filed Sector 12 (Bokaro) P.S. Case No.50 of 2016 against the petitioner as the petitioner has sold land of protected forest area and thereafter he verified about the land sold him and has found that informant also been cheated in the same manner by selling land of protected forest area. 
 13. Learned counsel for the informant has further submitted that Ajay Kumar, Forest Range Officer has subsequently filed a case vide Pindrajora P.S. Case no.87 of 2019, in which, the petitioner is accused, as such, this petitioner may not be enlarged on bail and he is in custody since 23.09.2019 in connection with Pindrajora P.S. Case No.39 of 2019 and he is in custody since 16.11.2019 in connection with Pindrajora P.S. Case No.87 of 2019 dated 16.11.2019. 
 14. Mrs. Sweta Singh, learned counsel for the State (appearing in B.A. No.2880 of 2020) has opposed the prayer for bail and has submitted that it is a case lodged by the Forest Range Officer under various sections i.e. 420, 465, 467, 468, 471 and 120BI.P.C. and the said case also relates with the Mauza- Bandhgora, having Thana No.35, Khata No.28 and Plot No.978 and the petitioner has 10 criminal antecedents, as such, he may not be enlarged on bail. 
 15. Learned Senior counsel for the petitioner has submitted that in all the cases which have been instituted against the petitioner, some are under consideration before the competent court of law and in some of the cases, he has been acquitted, as such, he may be granted bail to contest the case. 
 16. Considering rival submissions of the parties and having gone through the materials available on record and looking to the gravity of the offence that the protected forest land is being sold by the petitioner, this Court is not inclined-5-to grant bail to the petitioner. 
 17. Accordingly the prayer for bail of the petitioner in both the applications are hereby rejected. 
 18. Mr. Shekhar Sinha, learned P.P. and Ms. Sweta Singh, learned A.P.P. are directed to bring this order to the knowledge of the authority concern as well as to the knowledge of learned Advocate General of the State of Jharkhand so as to expedite the matter. 
 19. However, the learned trial court shall not prejudice by any observation made by this Court. The prosecution shall place its case and defence shall also place its case and the learned trial court will look into the merit of the case. 
 20. Needless to say that Government should come with a Standard Operating Procedure with regard to the protection of Government land, protected forest land, khas mahal land and other lands which are being sold in the same manner and the registering authority is not looking into the matter while registering the forest land. Circle Officers of the concerned area are not vigilant with regard to the Government land, while it is being mutated. The Forest Officers are sitting tight over the issue and are also not vigilant and only coming to the Court to protect themselves by lodging the FIR, as such, this Court directs Chief Secretary, Government of Jharkhand Ranchi, Principal Secretary (Law), Environment and Forest and Principal Secretary, Revenue & Land Reforms Department, Government of Jharkhand Ranchi as well as Director General of Police, Government of Jharkhand Ranchi to look into such matters where the Government land is being sold and litigations are being filed. The Government should come with a Standard Operating Procedure within a period of three months so as to protect the Government land. 
 21. Let a copy of this order be communicated through ""FAX"" to the Chief Secretary, Government of Jharkhand Ranchi, Principal Secretary (Law), Principal Secretary Revenue & Land Reforms Department, Government of Jharkhand Ranchi and Principal Secretary, Environment and Forest as well as Director General of Police, Government of Jharkhand Ranchi at once. 
 22. Let a copy of this order be handed over to Mr. Shekhar Sinha, learned P.P. and Mrs. Sweta Singh, learned A.P.P. for needful.

 ----- 
 Order No. 03 Dated: 15.09.2020 The present writ petition is taken up today through Video conferencing. 
 The present writ petition has been filed for issuance of writ of mandamus directing upon the respondent no. 3 - the District Sub-Registrar, Dhanbad to register the sale-deed presented before him in respect of Unit No. 07(B), Lower Ground Floor having built-up area 336.42 sq.ft. and common area 134.58 sq.ft. together with roof alongwith undivided proportionate share or interest in the land relating to other units of the building known as ""Capital Mall"" (hereinafter referred to as ""the said unit""). Further prayer has been made for issuance of direction upon the respondents not to refuse registration of sale-deed of the petitioner presented in respect of the said unit as the petitioner has the ownership and possession over the said unit without objection from any corner. 
 2. The factual background of the case as stated in the writ petition is that the petitioner is the owner of the land situated at Mouza-Saraidhella, Mouza No. 08, C.S Khata No. 53 (New Khata No. 
 296), Plot No. 2331 (New Plot No. 1723) and Mouza-Kolakusma, Mouza No. 12, C.S Khata No. 142 (New Khata No. 741), Plot No. 186 (New Plot No.284) total area measuring 1.18 acres. The jamabandi of the aforesaid land was also opened in the name of the petitioner and he is paying the rent of the same in the office of the Circle Officer, Dhanbad. The petitioner has a business of real estate and2construction and has constructed a multi-storied building over the said land commonly known as ""Capital Mall"" after getting the plan sanctioned by the competent authority ""MADA"". One purchaser intended to purchase Unit No. 07(B), Lower Ground Floor comprising of built-up area of 336.4 sq.ft. and common area of 134.58 sq.ft. together with roof alongwith the undivided proportionate share or interest relating to other units in the land of the building known as ""Capital Mall"" and as such an agreement to sale was prepared on 20.05.2020 and was presented before the respondent no. 3 for registration of the same in the name of the purchaser, however, the same has been kept pending without assigning any reason for the same. Hence, the present writ petition. 
 3. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the act of the respondent no. 3 is arbitrary and illegal and shows the colourable exercise of power as on the one hand, the respondent no. 3 has been approving for registration of sale-deed of other persons, but with respect to the petitioner, the same is kept pending that too, without assigning any reason for the same. It is further submitted that the petitioner has shown its entire legal documents relating to the ownership and possession of the land in question to the respondent no. 3, but the respondent no. 3 has arbitrarily not performed his statutory duty at his own whims due to which the petitioner has greatly been prejudiced. It is also submitted that the respondent no. 3 has no right to sit tight over the matter of registration of the instrument presented before him i.e., an agreement to sale pertaining to the property in question without assigning any valid and legal reason asSection 71of the Registration Act, 1908 specifically provides for recording reasons for refusal to register any document. It is also submitted that the respondent no. 3 is under legal obligation to give notice to the petitioner with respect to any action intended to be taken by him in this regard. The petitioner has also the right of being heard before any adverse decision is taken by the respondent no. 3 in relation to the presented document. The respondent no. 3 has no authority to prevent the petitioner from selling any part of the property in question to anyone3without there being any order of competent court or authority to that effect. 
 4. Mr. Manav Poddar, the learned AC to AAG-I, has opposed the contentions raised on behalf of the petitioner. 
 5. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the documents available on record, it appears that the petitioner through its all of the three directors as a first party and purchaser Urmila Devi Dokania as second party have presented an agreement to sale for its registration before the respondent no. 3, however, the same has been kept pending by him. The grievance of the petitioner is that after presenting the said instrument/document before the respondent no. 3, he has neither registered it nor has assigned any reason for refusal of the same. 
 6. To appreciate the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner, I have perusedSection 71of the Act, 1908 which reads as under: 
 71. Reasons of refusal to register to be recorded.-(1) Every Sub-Registrar refusing to register a document, except on the ground that the property to which it relates is not situate within his sub-district, shall make an order of refusal and record his reasons for such order in his Book No. 2, and endorse the words ""registration refused"" on the document; and, on application made by any person executing or claiming under the document, shall, without payment and unnecessary delay, give him a copy of the reasons so recorded. 
 (2) No registering officer shall accept for registration a document so endorsed unless and until, under the provisions hereinafter contained, the document is directed to be registered."" 
 7. On bare perusal of the provisions ofSection 71of the Act, 1908, it would be evident that if the District Sub-Registrar refuses to register a document, he is required to pass an order of refusal by recording his reasons for the same in the relevant book with an endorsement on the document that the registration has been refused.Section 72of the Act, 1908 also provides a forum of appeal before the Registrar against the order of the Sub-Registrar refusing to admit a document to registration. 
 8. Considering the aforesaid provisions of the Act, 1908, it may be construed that the District Sub-Registrar on presentation of document before him, cannot keep the same pending without any reason and if he does not intend to register the document so presented for any valid reason, he has to pass an order of refusal of registration with an endorsement on the document that the registration has been refused. 
 9. In the case in hand, since the petitioner through its directors and the above named purchaser have presented the agreement to sale before the respondent no. 3 for registration on 20.05.2020, the respondent no. 3 cannot keep the registration of the same pending. Thus, without entering into the merit of the case, the respondent no. 3 is directed either to admit the agreement to sale presented before him by the petitioner for registration or to refuse the registration of the same by passing an order in terms with the provisions ofSection 71of the Act, 1908. The respondent no. 3 is directed to conclude the said exercise within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this order. 
 10. The writ petition is accordingly disposed of in terms with the aforesaid observation/direction.

 Order No. 02 Dated: 15.09.2020 The present writ petition is taken up today through Video conferencing. 
 At the request of the learned counsel for the petitioner, the defects as pointed out by the office are ignored. 
 The present writ petition has been filed for quashing the notice as contained in letter no. 662 dated 08.09.2020 (Annexure-6 to the writ petition) issued by the respondent no. 4 - the Circle Officer, Gumla, whereby the said authority has directed the petitioner to vacate the premises mentioned in the said impugned notice. Further prayer has been made for issuance of direction upon the respondents to follow the mandate of the provisions of Section 36 and 39 of the Jharkhand Building (Lease, Rent & Eviction) Control Act, 2011 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Act, 2011""). The petitioner has also made the other related prayers. 
 2. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the impugned notice as contained in letter no. 662 dated 08.09.2020 passed by the respondent no. 4 is completely dehors the provisions of the Act, 2011 as the respondent no. 4 has no authority under the said Act to issue any direction to the petitioner for vacating the premises in question. It is further submitted that the respondent no. 3 - the Rent Controller-cum-Sub-Divisional Officer, Gumla has passed2the order in Eviction Suit No. 49 of 2020 preferred by the respondent no. 6 on 04.09.2020. However, the respondent no. 4 hurriedly issued the impugned notice of eviction just after four days of passing of the order i.e., on 08.09.2020 which is completely contrary to the provisions of Section 36 and 39 of the Act, 2011. The learned counsel for the petitioner also submits that till filing of the writ petition, copy of the order dated 04.09.2020 passed by the respondent no. 3 was not received by the petitioner and as such, the same could not be filed along with the writ petition. However, the said order passed by the respondent no. 3 was received by the petitioner in the afternoon of 11.09.2020 and after receiving the copy of the order dated 04.09.2020, the petitioner immediately filed an appeal under Section 36 of the Act, 2011 before the Appellate Authority i.e., the respondent no. 5 - the Deputy Commissioner, Gumla which has been registered as Eviction Appeal No. 22 of 2020-21. Under the said situation, the impugned notice dated 08.09.2020 passed by the respondent no. 4 being contrary to law, is liable to be set-aside. 
 3. Mr. Gaurav Abhishek, the learned AC to AG, submits that the impugned notice of eviction dated 08.09.2020 issued by the respondent no. 4 itself suggests that a copy of the order dated 04.09.2020 passed by the respondent no. 3 in Eviction Suit No. 49 of 2020 was annexed therewith. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner is not correct in submitting that the copy of order dated 04.09.2020 was received by the petitioner on 11.09.2020. Admittedly, the petitioner has already moved in appeal before the respondent no. 5 and, therefore, the present writ petition is not maintainable, rather the petitioner should pursue the said appeal before the respondent no. 5. 
 4. Mr. Arun Kumar, Advocate submits that he has instruction to appear on behalf of the respondent no. 6 and he shall be filing Vakalatnama today itself. It is also submitted that the order dated 04.09.2020 passed by the respondent no. 3 is completely justified and legal. The impugned notice of eviction dated 08.09.2020 issued by the respondent no. 4 is consequential to the order of eviction dated 04.09.2020 passed by the respondent no. 3 in Eviction Suit No.349 of 2020 and as such, the same requires no interference of this Court. 
 5. Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the content of the writ petition. The respondent no. 3 has passed the order of eviction against the petitioner (tenant) in Eviction Suit No. 49 of 2020 filed by the respondent no. 6. Section 36 of the Act, 2011 reads as under: 
 36. Appeal. - (1) Any person aggrieved by an order passed by the Controller may, within fifteen days from the date of receipt of such order by him, prefer an appeal in writing to the Appellate Authority. 
 (2) On such appeal being preferred, the Appellate Authority may - 
 (a) after perusing the memorandum of appeal and hearing the appellant, if necessary summarily dismiss the appeal, or 
 (b) call for records of the case from the Controller and after examining such records and, if necessary, making such further enquiry as he thinks fit decide the appeal, 
 (c) such appeal shall be decided within the six months. 
 (3) Subject to the provision of sub-section (2), the decision of the Appellate Authority and subject only to such decision where an appeal lies, an order of the Controller shall be final and shall not be liable to be questioned in any Court of law whether in suit or other proceeding by way of appeal or revision. 
 6. On perusal of the provisions of Section 36 of the Act, 2011, it would be evident that any person aggrieved by the order passed by the Rent Controller has the liberty to prefer an appeal within fifteen days from the date of receipt of the order of the Rent Controller. The learned counsel for the petitioner on instruction, has contended that the order dated 04.09.2020 passed by the respondent no. 3 was received by the petitioner in the afternoon of 11.09.2020 i.e., after three days of issuance of impugned notice dated 08.09.2020 by the respondent no. 4. The said fact has, however, been disputed by the learned counsel for the State and the respondent no. 6 by submitting that the impugned notice dated 08.09.2020 itself mentions the fact that the same has also accompanied the order dated404.09.2020 passed by the respondent no. 3. 
 7. Be that as it may. Even if it is assumed that the order dated 04.09.2020 passed by the respondent no. 3 has been received by the petitioner on 08.09.2020 alongwith the impugned notice, the same cannot justify the notice dated 08.09.2020 as it was issued by the respondent no. 4 prior to lapse of fifteen days from the date of issuance of the order dated 04.09.2020 passed by the respondent no. 3 much less the receipt of the same by the petitioner. No notice of eviction can be issued within the period of fifteen days from the date of service of the orders passed by the Rent Controller i.e., the period during which the aggrieved person has the liberty to prefer appeal. 
 8. Now, coming to the question of jurisdiction of the respondent no. 4 in issuing the impugned notice of eviction against the petitioner, reference may be made to the provisions of Section 39 of the Act, 2011 which read as under: 
 39. Execution of orders of Controller, Appellate Authority and Commissioner. - (1) Every order of the Controller passed under this Act, where no appeal against such order has been preferred under sub- section (1) of Section 36, every order of the Appellate Authority on appeal under sub-section (2) of Section 36 and every order of the Commissioner passed in revision under Section 37 shall be executed by the Controller as if such orders where an order passed by such Controller. 
 (2) the Controller, Appellate Authority and the Commissioner, in exercise of the powers conferred upon it under this Act shall be treated as a Court underSections 195and340of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (Act 2 of 1974) and any proceedings before it shall be regarded as judicial proceedings underSections 193and228of Indian Penal Code. 
 9. On perusal of the provisions of Section 39 of the Act, 2011, it may be construed that as per sub-section (1), every order of the Controller, the Appellate Authority and the Revisional Authority has to be executed by the Controller himself. The Circle Officer has not been conferred any such power of issuing notice of eviction under the provisions of the Act, 2011 to implement the order of the Controller. Hence, the impugned notice dated 08.09.2020 issued by the respondent no. 4 being without jurisdiction cannot be sustained in law5and as such, the same is quashed/set-aside. Since the petitioner has already preferred an appeal against the order dated 04.09.2020 passed by the respondent no. 3 in Eviction Suit No. 49 of 2020 which has been registered as Eviction Appeal No. 22 of 2020-21 in the court of respondent no. 5, there is no need to go into the merit of the contention of the respective parties. The petitioner as well as the respondent no. 6 may pursue their respective cases before the respondent no. 5. 
 10. The writ petition is accordingly disposed of. It is, however, clarified that the present order will not come in the way of the Controller to take subsequent steps in accordance with law.

 Through Video Conferencing 19/15.09.2020 
 1. Heard Mr. Binod Singh, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner along with Ms. Satakshi, Amicus. 
 2. Heard Mr. Tarun Kumar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party-State. 
 Arguments on behalf of the petitioner 
 3. The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the impugned judgments are perverse and are fit to be set- aside, in as much as, there is no evidence on record that it was the petitioner who had manipulated the cheques involved in the present case. He submits that there are three cheques involved in the present case i.e. amounting to Rs. 60,000/- Rs. 30,000/- and Rs. 30,000/- respectively and so far as the allegation in connection with cheque amount of Rs. 60,000/- is concerned, it has been alleged against the petitioner that he had interpolating the cheque by inserting 'ty' in front of six and inserting one zero after Rs, 6,000/-. He also submits that the cheque was encashed at the bank and there is no evidence that the interpolation had taken place at the end of the petitioner. He has also submitted that so far as other two cheques i.e. of Rs. 30,000/- and Rs. 30,000/- are concerned, there has been allegation of interpolation in those cheuqes also, but the counter-foil of the cheque also indicated that the cheque was being issued for an amount of Rs. 30,000/- each and accordingly there could have been no interpolation in the2cheque by the petitioner. The learned counsel submits that it has been recorded by the learned trial court that it was the banker who was cheated and it is not clear as to how the banker has been cheated, as the amount did not belong to the bank, but the amount belong to the government. The learned counsel has submitted that there is no element of entrustment and there is no direct evidence against the petitioner. The learned counsel has also submitted that the investigating officer of the case has not been examined which has caused serious prejudice to the petitioner. The learned counsel has submitted that there has been no wrongful loss to the banker and accordingly no criminal case of forgery, cheating or criminal breach of trust is made out against the petitioner. The learned counsel further submits that there is no expert opinion on record to show that the interpolation which was made in the cheque was under the handwriting of the present petitioner and therefore, the finding of the learned courts below that the petitioner had interpolated the cheque is itself perverse and is fit to be set-aside. 
 4. The learned counsel has also submitted that there has been unreasonable and unexplained delay in lodging the FIR and further from perusal of the written report i.e. the FIR, it appears that the same is not a complaint but rather the same is an explanation on behalf of the informant to save his skin from the entire episode. 
 5. The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that without prejudice to the aforesaid submission made on behalf of the petitioner, one more important aspect of the matter is that the present petitioner is admittedly a public servant, the petitioner could not have been held criminally liable for the acts and omissions, if any, on the part of the petitioner without there being a sanction underSection 197of Code of Criminal Procedure. The learned counsel has relied upon the judgment3passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (2000) 8 SCC 500 Paras-8 and 9 to submit that in absence of sanction, the entire conviction and sentence of the petitioner are fit to be set- aside. The learned counsel submits that the point regarding sanction has been taken by the petitioner before the learned lower appellate court, but that aspect of the matter has not been properly examined and the learned lower appellate court has failed to consider that the petitioner was acting in discharge of his official duty. 
 Arguments on behalf of opposite party 
 6. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of opposite party-State, on the other hand, has opposed the prayer and has submitted that as per the FIR, the petitioner was the custodian of the cash-book etc. and accordingly, the interpolation which was made by the petitioner in the cheque was to be explained by the petitioner himself. He also submits that so far as the cheque amounting to Rs. 60,000/- is concerned, even the counter-foil of the cheque clearly indicated that the cheque was issued only for an amount of Rs. 6,000/- and not for Rs. 60,000/- and admittedly the cheque was handed-over to the petitioner for encashment and the bank officials had produced records to show that the amount of Rs. 60,000/- was handed over to the petitioner. He submits that the cheque being in custody of the petitioner and it was encashed by the petitioner , it was for the petitioner to explain the interpolation in the cheque, but the petitioner did not furnish any explanation in his statement recorded underSection 313of Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 7. However, during the course of arguments, the learned counsel did not dispute the fact that as per the exhibits recorded in the impugned judgment, the counter-foil of the cheques amounting to Rs. 30,000/- also indicated amount of Rs. 
 30,000/- only and it is also not in dispute that the cheques were being issued by the informant under her signature. The learned counsel further submits that there are concurrent finding of facts recorded by the learned courts below and it involves misappropriation of public money, therefore, no sympathetic view is called for in the present case. 
 8. The learned counsel has submitted that the learned lower appellate court has relied upon the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case ofPrakash Singh Badal vs. State of Punjabreported in (2007) 1 SCC 1, wherein it has been held that the offences relating toSections 467,465,471and120-B of Indian Penal Code can by no stretch of imagination, by their very nature, be regarded as having been committed by any public servant while acting or purporting to act in discharge of official duty. The learned counsel submits that the sanction for prosecution will be required only when the petitioner would have acted in discharge of his official duty, but in view of the specific allegations made against the petitioner regarding interpolation in the cheque in order to withdraw much higher amount than the amount for which the cheque was issued, his act cannot be said to be in discharge of his official duty and this aspect of the matter has been duly considered by the learned lower appellate court which does not suffer from any perversity. He further submits that in the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (2000) 8 SCC 500, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the sanction would be required once it is found that the public servant was acting in discharge of his official duty and accordingly, the judgment which has been relied upon by the petitioner does not help the petitioner. The learned counsel submits that there is no scope of re-appreciation of evidence in5revisional jurisdiction and accordingly, the present revision petition is fit to be dismissed. 
 9. Arguments concluded. 
 10. Judgment reserved.

 Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that he may be allowed to make necessary correction with regard to name of the Act, as mentioned in Para-1 of the bail application. 
 Prayer is allowed. 
 Let the said correction be made after 30 days after physical court starts. Joint Registrar (Judicial) is directed to ensure the compliance of the same. Heard, learned counsel, Mr. Ankit Vishal assisted by learned counsel for the petitioners, Mr. Ajay Kumar Sah and learned counsel for the State, Mrs. Ruby Pandey. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that petitioners have prayed for grant of regular bail in connection with Namkum P.S. Case No.274 of 2019, corresponding to S.T. No.78 of 2020 for the offence registered underSections 302/34IPC and Sections 3/4 of Prevention of Witch (Daain) Practices Act. Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that five persons have been named in the FIR including these two petitioners. He has further submitted that except suspicion, there is nothing against the petitioners. Learned counsel for the petitioners has further submitted that as per the FIR, it is alleged that younger son of petitioner No.1, Fauda Munda was ill, as such, they were apprehending that the deceased was playing black magic and it is alleged that these petitioners came to the house of the informant in-search of the deceased, but did not find her and subsequently no body has seen these petitioners with the deceased nor there was any eye-witness to the occurrence and on recovery of dead-body, an FIR has been lodged against five named accused persons on suspicion. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners has further submitted that the Police has recorded statement of the informant at Para-7 of the case diary, confessional statement of the co-accused, Khudia Munda at Para-29 of the case diary and post- mortem report at Para-42 of the case diary, but there is no material with regard to any recovery pursuant to the confession, as such, confession before the Police is not-2-admissible under the law. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners has further submitted that petitioners are in custody since 28.09.2019, as such, petitioners may be enlarged on bail as the case is under trial vide S.T. No.78 of 2020 and the charge has already been framed. Learned counsel for the State has opposed the prayer for bail and has submitted that these petitioners were searching the deceased and they have confessed their guilt. From the post-mortem report, it appears that the deceased was brutally killed, as such, these petitioners may not be enlarged on regular bail who might have involvement in commission of the offence. 
 After hearing, learned counsel for the parties and perusing the materials brought on record and looking to the facts and circumstances of the case and since the petitioners have been apprehended on suspicion and they were named in the FIR on suspicion, as such, this Court is inclined to grant Bail to the petitioners. Accordingly, petitioners (Fauda Munda and Rushu Munda), are directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned A.J.C- XV-cum-FTC (CAW), Ranchi in connection with Namkum P.S.

 Order No. 06 Dated: 15.09.2020 The present writ petition is taken up today through Video conferencing. 
 At the request of the learned counsel for the petitioner, the defects as pointed out by the office are ignored. 
 The present writ petition has been filed for issuance of direction upon the respondents to pay the dues of Rs. 8,46,227/- for the period 21.05.2014 to 20.04.2015, Rs. 8,48,584/- for the period 21.05.2015 to 20.04.2016 and Rs. 4,21,934/- for the period 21.04.2016 to 19.11.2016 in relation to the emergency works of maintenance of railway tracks executed by the petitioner in view of the safety of the tracks on the direction of the respondents. 
 2. Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the content of the writ petition. 
 3. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner had been executing the work of maintenance of railway tracks with the respondents since 2006. The contract period for the same was valid till 20.05.2014. Since a proposal for extending the contract period was under process, the petitioner continued to work2for the abovementioned period on existing terms and conditions of contract by way of oral instruction of the authorities of Raw Materials Division, Bhawnathpur Group of Mines, Bhawnathpur, Steel Authority of India Ltd. and in anticipation of issuance of work order to that effect. The petitioner had again been awarded the work of maintenance of railway tracks from Meral Gram to Bhawnathpur Railway Siding by way of work order dated 20.01.2017 for the period 20.11.2016 to 19.11.2017, however, on completion of the aforesaid works, no payment was made to him. The petitioner made several representations before the respondent no. 5 - the Deputy General Manager, Raw Materials Division, Bhawnathpur Group of Mines, Bhawnathpur, Steel Authority of India Ltd. in the year 2016 and 2017 requesting inter alia to make due payment to him for the said work done, however, the same were not responded. Subsequently, the petitioner filed an application under Right toInformation Act, 2005 before the respondent no. 5 on 25.11.2017, in response to which the petitioner was informed vide letter dated 30.01.2018 that the works of repair/maintenance of railway tracks from Bhawnathpur to Meral Gram for the period 21.05.2014 to 19.11.2017 were awarded to M/s Awadhesh Kumar Singh (the petitioner). It was also informed vide letter dated 30.01.2018 that no payment was made in relation to the said works. 
 4. Mr. Vijay Kant Dubey, the learned counsel for the respondents, submits that admittedly, no work order has been issued in favour of the petitioner for executing the works in question. Only by replying to certain information sought by the petitioner under Right toInformation Act, 2005, it cannot be said that the dues claimed by the petitioner in the writ petition has been admitted by the respondents. However, if the petitioner prefers a fresh representation before the respondent no. 4 - the General Manager, Raw Materials Division, Kuteshwar Limestone Mines, Katni (M.P.), Steel Authority of India Ltd., the petitioner's claim will be considered and appropriate decision will be taken in this regard. 
 5. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and keeping in view the nature of prayer made in the present writ3petition, without entering into the merit of the claim of the petitioner, he is given liberty to prefer a fresh representation before the respondent no. 4 along with the supporting documents in this regard. On receipt of the said representation, the respondent no. 4 after calling for the relevant records and on making due enquiry, if so required, as well as on providing adequate opportunity of hearing to the petitioner/his representative, shall take an informed decision within a period of four months from the date of filing of the representation.

 Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that in the counter affidavit at paragraphs-10, the State has referred the statement of Madan Nayak and Manoj Nayak, who have stated underSection 161Cr.P.C. that this petitioner has given threatening to Seva Nayak, father of the deceased by saying that he will be sent to the same place where his son has gone, as such, there is no legal material with regard to the complicity of the petitioner in the alleged offence and as such, petitioner, who is in custody since 28.03.2019, may be enlarged on bail. 
 Learned counsel for the State, Mr. Abhay Kumar Tiwari, has opposed the prayer for bail and has submitted that this petitioner has three criminal antecedents of similar nature and this is fourth case, if he is enlarged on bail, there is every likelihood that he will tamper-2-the evidence, abscond from the trial and he will come up with another offence, as he has criminal antecedents, as such, this court may not grant bail to the petitioner. 
 Considering the rival submissions of the parties, looking into the materials collected during the investigation, since there is no eye- witness to the occurrence, as such, considering the period of custody since 28.03.2019, the petitioner is directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each in connection with Karra P.S. Case No. 80/2016 corresponding to G.R. No. 410/2016 (S.T. No. 144/2019) to the satisfaction of learned Distrct & Additional Sessions Judge, 1st, Khunti on the following conditions:

 This case was listed/ supposed to be listed before the Lawazima Board for passing an order in respect of the defects, pointed out by the office. 
 Considering the pandemic situation where the Court has minimized the footfall of the lawyers and their Clerks in the Court, this court felt proper to get all the cases listed before this Court so that the defects can be looked into at this stage only. Thus, this case is listed today before this Court directly. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner prays to ignore the defect and take up the matter on merits. 
 Defects stand ignored. 
 In this application, the petitioner has challenged the order dated 03.08.2005, by which cognizance of the offence punishable underSections 147,148,323&341of the Indian Penal Code has been taken and thereafter, summon has been issued to him. 
 After 15 years of order taking cognizance, the same is being challenged. From the order sheet, which has been annexed, I find that the petitioner was well aware of the proceeding as earlier also he approached this Court by filing Cr. M.P. No. 1902 of 2012, challenging the order by which coercive steps was taken against him underSections 82&83Cr. P.C. He got relief from this Court also in the said case. This clearly shows that the petitioner was well aware of the proceedings. In this 15 years, he did not even chose to challenge the order taking cognizance and now after 15 years he woke up from slumber and challenged the order taking cognizance by filing this application. This is a very serious laches on the part of the petitioner. 
 This court feels that extraordinary jurisdiction and discretionary jurisdiction of this Court cannot be used in favour of the petitioner, who approached this Court after 15 years knowing fully about the proceedings. Since there is serious laches on the part of the petitioner, I am not inclined to exercise my jurisdiction underSection 482of the Code of Criminal Procedure, whereby order taking cognizance dated 03.08.2005, has been challenged by the petitioner after 15 years. Accordingly, this application stands dismissed. 
 The Trial Court is directed to proceed and conclude the trial at the earliest.

 Learned senior counsel for the petitioners submits that so far as the petitioner nos. 2 and 3 are concerned they have already been arrested and this application accordingly has become infructuous as against them. 
 This application stands dismissed as infructuous as against petitioner nos. 2 and 3.

 Heard the parties through video conferencing. Learned counsel for the petitioner personally undertakes to remove the defects as pointed out by the stamp reporter within two weeks after the lockdown period is over. 
 In view of the personal undertaking of the learned counsel for the petitioner, the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter are ignored for the present. 
 The Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the allegation against the petitioner is that the co-accused persons used the car of the petitioner and were consuming liquor and when the officer in-charge challenged them, they assaulted the officer in- charge of the police station causing injuries to him. It is, further, submitted that the allegation against the petitioner are all false. It is also submitted that petitioner is not named in the F.I.R. nor the apprehended co-accused persons have taken the name of the petitioner. It is then submitted that the petitioner is ready and willing to pay Rs. 20,000/- as ad interim victim compensation to the informant without prejudice to his defence in this case and undertakes to cooperate with the investigation of the case. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned Addl. P.P. opposes the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail. 
 Considering the submissions of the counsels and the fact as discussed above, I am of the opinion that it is a fit case where the above named petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. Hence, in the event of his arrest or surrender within a period of four weeks from the date of this order, he shall be released on bail on depositing a demand draft of Rs. 20,000/- as ad interim victim compensation in favour of informant and on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Additional Sessions Judge -III, Latehar, in connection with Netarhat P.S.

 ------- 
 02/15.09.2020 Heard Mr. Prakash Chandra, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners and Mr. Bishambhar Shastri, learned A.P.P. for the State. 
 The petitioners have prayed for grant of anticipatory bail, as they are apprehending their arrest in connection with Devipur P.S. Case No. 96/2020. 
 Mr. Prakash Chandra, learned counsel for the petitioners, at the outset, submits that he is withdrawing this application so far as the petitioner no. 2 is concerned since he has already been arrested. 
 In view of the said submission this application stands dismissed as withdrawn as against petitioner no. 2. 
 So far as the rest petitioners are concerned the allegation reveals that while the informant and his son were digging a plinth the accused persons who were variously armed had assaulted them. 
 Specific allegation of assault apart from the petitioner no. 2 whose case has already been withdrawn by the learned counsel for the petitioners also rests upon petitioner nos. 1 and 3 as they had assaulted the informant with a sword and bhala. 
 In such circumstances, therefore, I am not inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner nos. 1 and 3. 
 However, so far as the petitioner nos. 4 to 7 are concerned the allegations are general and omnibus in nature. 
 In such view of the matter, therefore, petitioner nos. 4 to 7 are directed to surrender before the learned court below within a period of four weeks and on such surrender, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned C.J.M., Deoghar in connection with Devipur P.S.

 2/15.09.2020 Heard the parties. 
 The petitioner is apprehending his arrest in connection with Argora P.S. Case No. 300 of 2016 corresponding to G. R. No. 5204 of 2016. 
 The informant is in the business of development of land by constructing multi-storied building. It has been alleged that the accused persons had approached the informant for developing 9 Kathas of land of which they were the joint owners. A development agreement was entered into and the accused persons had received Rs. 12,55,000/- from the informant who also spent Rs. 8 lacs in primary development of the said land. It has been alleged that the informant later on came to know that the accused persons had entered into an agreement for sale with one Sushil Kumar Gupta and had also taken Rs. 1,65,90,000/- from him. 
 It has been stated by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner while referring to the development agreement that neither the petitioner was the signatory to the said agreement nor in the Schedule D which is with respect to the payment received by the accused persons, the petitioner's signature is evident. Learned senior counsel further submits that the main accused in the present case are Amitabh Sahay and Ashim Kumar who were dealing with the informant and in fact they had received certain amount from the informant which would appear from the Schedule D of the agreement and on instruction, Mr. A. K. Kashyap, submits that the amount has already been returned back to the informant. He has further stated that on being noticed underSection 41Aof Cr.P.C., both Amitabh Sahay and Ashim Kumar have accepted-2-the responsibility of the entire dealing with respect to the transfer of land in favour of the informant. 
 Learned A.P.P. for the State opposed the prayer for anticipatory bail. 
 It appears from the development agreement itself that although there are 5 coloums, but the signature of the petitioner is conspicuously absent in the same. In fact the development agreement seems to have been signed by Amitabh Sahay and Ashim Kumar and in the Schedule D of the agreement which is the amount which has been received on account of the said sale deeds, once again Amitabh Sahay and Ashim Kumar who have received the amount had accorded their acknowledgement regarding receipt of the said amount. The signature of the petitioner also does not find place in the Schedule D of the agreement. 
 Learned A.P.P. has not controverted the contents of the development agreement brought on record by the petitioner. 
 Thus, there appears to be no documentary evidence that would indicate that the petitioner was a party to the said agreement and being in receipt of the certain amount consequent to entering into said agreement. 
 Regard being had to the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. 
 Accordingly, the petitioner above named is directed to surrender in the court below within four weeks and pray for bail, and in that event, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each, to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, Ranchi in connection with Argora P.S. Case No. 300 of 2016 corresponding to G. R. No. 5204 of 2016, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Codeof Criminal Procedure.

 Heard the parties. 
 The petitioner, in this application, has challenged the order dated 10.12.2019, by which summon has been issued to him, as the cognizance was already taken underSections 364,302/34of the Indian Penal Code. 
 I have gone through the impugned order. From the impugned order I find that the police submitted final form in favour of this petitioner finding no material against him and he was not charge sheeted. But the court below differed with the finding recorded in the final form and, thereafter, issued summon to this petitioner. What are the materials to summon this petitioner, has not been mentioned in the impugned order by which summon has been issued. Some paragraphs of the case diary have been referred, but what are the prima-facie materials to summon the petitioner has not been mentioned. The court has to apply its mind carefully while issuing summons when differing with the police report. The impugned order doesnot reflect any reason for differing. 
 Considering the aforesaid fact and in view of the order passed by this Court in the case of ""Amresh Kumar Dhiraj & Ors.- versus- State of Jharkhand & Anr, reported in 2020 (1) JLJR 199 (Jhr.)"", I am inclined to allow this application. Accordingly, this application is allowed. The impugned summoning order dated 10.12.2019, passed by the Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Rajmahal in G.R. No. 21 of 2010, whereby the petitioner has been summoned, is, hereby, set aside. The matter is remitted to the Court below to pass a fresh speaking order stating as to what are the materials to summon the petitioner in this case.

 The petitioners apprehend their arrest in connection with Manjhion P.S. Case No. 46 of 2020. 
 It has been alleged that on 27.4.2020, the accused persons started abusing the informant under the influence of liquor. On protest, they had assaulted the informant and her husband, which resulted in their suffering from several injuries. Sudhir Kumar and Banshi Ram had tried to intervene and they were assaulted with a tangi. 
 It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners that infact there was a free fight between both the sides and one Umesh Ram who appears to be the father of petitioner nos. 3 and 4 had also instituted a case against the informant party being Manjhion P.S. Case No. 45 of 2020. It has further been submitted that in the said case, one of the injured-Baban Ram, who happens to be the husband of petitioner 2 had succumbed to his injury. It has also been submitted that so far as petitioners are concerned, the allegations are general and omnibus in nature and specific allegation has been levelled against Umesh Ram and Umesh Chandravanshi. 
 Learned A.P.P. has opposed the prayer for anticipatory bail of the petitioners. 
 It appears that there has been a case and counter case between the parties on account of a free fight between them. It further appears that there is a previous enmity between both the sides relating to a land dispute and for which a proceeding undersection 107Cr.P.C. was also pending. As stated above, the husband of petitioner no. 2 had already succumbed to his injury on account of the assault committed upon him from the side of the informant party. 
 Regard being had to the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioners. 
 Accordingly, the petitioners, named above, are directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, they will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- ( Ten thousand only) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st class, Garhwa in connection with Manjhion P.S. Case No. 46 of 2020, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 This application stands allowed.

 Learned counsel for the petitioner seeks permission of this court to make necessary correction in paragraph-5 of the petition, where this petitioner has been wrongly cited as mother-in-law, though this petitioner Rajesh Ray is husband of the deceased. 
 Prayer is allowed. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner is permitted to make necessary correction in paragraph-5 of the petition. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the petitioner Rajesh Ray has prayed for grant of regular bail in connection with Hansdiha P.S. Case No. 43/2019 for the offence registered under Section 304(B)/34 I.P.C. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that as per the investigation, there is no allegation against this petitioner nor any person has stated underSection 161Cr.P.C. that they have either seen this petitioner torturing the wife for demand of dowry, rather his wife has consumed poison mistakenly and due to which, she became ill and taken to the hospital, but on the way to hospital, she died. This information was given to the informant, but even then, an F.I.R. was lodged. The deceased has no external or internal injury in the post-mortem report, as such, petitioner, who is in custody since 10.05.2019, may be enlarged on bail. 
 Learned counsel for the State, Mr. S. P. Jha, Additional Public Prosecutor has opposed the prayer for bail and has submitted that all the four ingredients for constituting an offence underSection 304B-2-IPCis available on record. The presumption is against the petitioner as perSection 113Bof the Indian Evidence Act, as such, petitioner has to discharge his onus. 
 Learned counsel for the State has further submitted that in this case, case diary, postmortem report and FSL report are necessary for proper adjudication of the bail application, as such, State may be granted four weeks' time to file detail counter affidavit on the basis of aforesaid documents. 
 Considering the rival submissions of the parties, State counsel is granted four weeks' time to file detail counter affidavit on the basis of post-mortem report, FSL report and the material collected during investigation. 
 Put up this case after four weeks.

 Order No. 03 Dated: 15.09.2020 The present writ petition is taken up today through Video conferencing. 
 The present writ petition has been filed for issuance of direction upon the respondents to issue revised energy bill after deleting the components of DPS in view of the fact that the respondents have raised wrongful energy bill against the petitioner and have charged DPS thereon and after much persuasion, the respondents have rectified the bill, however, DPS has not been removed even after correction of the energy bill. Further prayer has been made for issuance of direction upon the respondents to fix the payment of the corrected energy bill on suitable number of instalments considering the fact that huge amount has been accumulated due to raising of wrong energy bill and laches on the part of the respondents in revision of the same in accordance with law. 
 At the outset, Mr. Manoj Kumar, the learned Sr. SC, Jharkhand Urja Vikas Nigam Limited, submits that the present writ2petition is not maintainable in view of alternative remedy available to the petitioner to approach the Vidyut Upbhokta Shikayat Nivaran Forum, Ranchi created by the respondent-Jharkhand Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (JUVNL) underSection 42(5)of the Electricity Act, 2003.

The same is accordingly dismissed as not maintainable at this stage. 
 The petitioner is, however, at liberty to approach the said forum for redressal of its grievance. If the petitioner prefers a complaint before the Vidyut Upbhokta Shikayat Nivaran Forum, Ranchi within fifteen days from today, the same shall be entertained by the said forum on its merit and be disposed of as early as possible, preferably within a period of three months from the date of filing of the complaint.

 Oral Order 10/Dated: 15.09.2020 With consent of the parties, hearing of this matter has been done through video conferencing. They have no complaint about any audio and visual quality. 
 I.A. No.3267 of 2019 (in L.P.A. No. 487 of 2018) Learned counsel appearing for the appellant does not press this application for amendment in the memo of appeal in view of the another appeal having already been preferred by the appellant against the impugned order passed in the connected writ petition. 
 Hence, this Interlocutory Application being I.A. No.3267 of 2019 is dismissed as not pressed. 
 L.P.A. No. 487 of 2018 and L.P.A. No. 852 of 2019 Heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellant as also the respondents-State and the State of Bihar. 
 At the time of hearing of these appeals, learned counsel for the appellant has raised an issue that the order of punishment dated 07.08.2004 was without jurisdiction, inasmuch as the concerned-2-Officer (the writ petitioner) was already allocated the cadre of State of Jharkhand underSection 72of the Bihar Reorganisation Act, 2000. 
 Though this issue has not been raised before the learned Writ Court and does not find place even in the pleading, however, since the issue touches the issue of jurisdiction, which is purely a question of law based upon the admitted facts, this Court permits the writ petitioner to bring on record the order of the competent authority passed underSection 72of the Bihar Reorganisation Act, 2000. 
 Learned counsel for the State has stated that many documents brought on record in one of the appeals are missing in the other. 
 Hence, let the missing annexure be filed by the learned counsel for the appellant in the concerned appeal after serving a copy thereof to the learned counsel appearing for the State of Jharkhand and the State of Bihar. 
 As prayed, put up this case on 12th of October, 2020.

 for the State through Video Conferencing. The lawyers have no objection with regard to the proceeding, which has been held through Video Conferencing today at 11.15 a.m. They have no complain in respect to the audio and video clarity and quality. 
 2. This case was listed/supposed to be listed before the Lawazima Board for seeking an order in respect of the defects, pointed out by the Office. 
 3. Considering the pandemic situation where the Court has minimized the footfall of the lawyers and their Clerks in the Court, this Court felt proper to get all the cases listed before this Court so that the defects can be looked into at this stage only. Thus, this case is listed today before this Court directly. 
 4. Counsel for the petitioners prays to ignore the defects and take up this matter on merits. The defects stand ignored for the present. 
 5. Petitioners have challenged the First Information Report being Chakulia Police Station Case No.41 of 2019, registered for offences underSections 461,379,420,120Band34of the Indian Penal Code, and has prayed to quash the same. 
 6. Counsel for the petitioners submits that the First Information Report has been lodged with a malafide intention. Referring to Annexure 2, which is, admittedly, an agreement, he submits that since there was long standing transactions between the parties, a cheque was given to the informant in discharge of liability. He submits that amount was transferred-: 2 :-through bank account by debiting bank account of the informant and crediting bank account of wife of petitioner No.1. 
 7. Quashing of First Information Report means quashing the investigating and throttling the criminal prosecution at an initial stage. It is well settled principle of law that when prima facie cognizable offence is made out, which needs investigation, First Information Report cannot be quashed. After going through the First Information Report, I find that there is allegation that the petitioners came to the shop of the informant for a business deal. A cancelled cheque was taken from the informant, but, the cheque book was kept there on the table. Some cheques were signed by the informant in the cheque book and were kept blank. It is allegation of the informant that these petitioners have taken some blank cheque and it was utilized by them deceitfully. The aforesaid allegation, definitely, makes out an offence, which needs an investigation. Whether there was any business transaction between the petitioners and the informant has to be investigated. The genuineness of the agreement, which the petitioners are relying upon also needs to be enquired and investigated into and only after thorough investigation, one can conclude whether the allegations in the First Information Report is correct or false. 
 8. Since the allegations in the First Information Report make out an offence and needs to be investigated, I am not inclined to entertain this criminal miscellaneous petition and accede to the prayer made by the petitioners. Accordingly, this criminal miscellaneous petition is, hereby, dismissed.

 5. Petitioner has challenged the First Information Report being Mohammadganj Police Station Case No. 32 of 2019 (G.R. No. 1215 of 2019) registered for an offence underSections 376,511of the Indian Penal Code and has also challenged the order dated 04.10.2019 passed by the Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Palamau at Daltonganj, by which cognizance of offence underSection 376,511of the Indian Penal Code has been taken and the petitioner has been summoned. 
 6. Counsel for the petitioner submits that there are discrepancies in the written report and the statement of the victim recorded underSection 164of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He submits that though in the first information report, the victim has stated that there was an attempt to commit rape, yet in her statement recorded underSection 164of the Code of Criminal Procedure, victim has stated that the petitioner has only assaulted the victim-: 2 :-and there is no whisper of attempt to commit rape. On this ground, petitioner has challenged the First Information Report and the order taking cognizance. 
 7. When I go through the First Information Report, I find that there is an allegation that the petitioner has tried to commit rape after entering into the house of the informant. There is also an allegation of assault. Though in the statement recorded underSection 164of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the victim has not narrated about the attempt to commit rape, yet she has stated about the assault inflicted by the petitioner. From the First Information Report, a primafacie offence, which is cognizable, is made out. The Court below has, thus, rightly taken cognizance, and has issued summons. Veracity of the statement of the victim recorded underSection 164of the Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be looked into at this stage. Since an offence is made out, which is cognizable, the Court below has correctly taken cognizance of the offence. 
 8. On the facts of this case, the First Information Report or the order taking cognizance cannot be quashed. Accordingly, this criminal miscellaneous petition is, hereby, dismissed. Petitioner is at liberty to take all the points at the time of framing of charge, if the charge has already not been framed.

Case No.902 of 2017, whereby non-bailable warrant of arrest has been issued after rejecting the petition underSection 317of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the petitioner. 
 6. Counsel for the petitioner submits that after rejecting the petition underSection 317of the Code of Criminal Procedure, at least an opportunity should have been given to the petitioner to appear before the Court. He submits that subsequent orders dated 06.02.2019 and 26.03.2019 issuing processes underSection 82of the Code of Criminal Procedure and attachment order in terms ofSection 83of the Code of Criminal Procedure are also bad as the same are only oneline orders without recording any subjective satisfaction. He submits that all these orders are absolutely bad. He submits that the petitioner should not have been declared permanent absconder and-: 2 :-the order dated 13.05.2019 declaring the petitioner a permanent absconder is also equally bad. He lastly submits that the petitioner will appear before the Court below. 
 7. I have heard the counsel for the parties and have gone through the records. Order dated 23.10.2018 suggests that the case was fixed for evidence. No witnesses were present on that date. The next date was fixed for 04.12.2018, when also no witnesses were present. Court below, thereafter on 07.12.2018, when a petition underSection 317of the Code of Criminal Procedure was moved on behalf of petitioner, rejected the same and issued warrant of arrest. The ground for rejecting the petition underSection 317of the Code of the Code of Criminal Procedure is that on earlier occasion, the petitioner was directed to remain physically present, but he was not present. Admittedly, the petitioner was on bail. Admittedly, the case was at the stage of evidence. On 07.12.2018, there is nothing recorded in the ordersheet to suggest that witnesses were present. On earlier occasion also witnesses were not present. This Court fails to understand as to when witnesses were not present, what purpose would have been served to direct the petitioner to appear in person when he is already represented through lawyer. This approach of the Court below is erroneous and is not acceptable. When an accused is allowed to be represented underSection 317of the Code of Criminal Procedure and there is no effective proceeding, which is being conducted on a particular date, then directing the petitioner to appear in person will only be a harassment to him. The orders dated 06.02.2019 and 26.03.2019 issuing processes underSection 82of the Code of Criminal Procedure and attachment order in terms ofSection 83of the Code of Criminal Procedure are absolutely cryptic and have been passed without recording any satisfaction. Thus, I am inclined to set aside all the three orders, i.e., orders dated 07.12.2018, 06.02.2019 and 26.03.2019 passed in C.P. Case No.902 of 2017. Consequentially, the order dated 13.05.2019 whereby petitioner has been declared a permanent absconder is also, hereby, set aside. The petitioner will remain on same bail bond. 
 8. This criminal miscellaneous petition, accordingly, stands allowed.

 7. Counsel for the petitioners submits that by no stretch of imagination, on the facts narrated in the complaint, offence underSection 420of the Indian Penal Code is made out. He submits that the Court below has wrongly taken cognizance underSection 420of the Indian Penal Code. 
 8. After hearing the counsel for the parties, I have gone through the complaint petition. From perusal of the complaint petition, I find that a-: 2 :-cognizable offence is made out, thus, the Court below took cognizance of the offence. So far as the contention of the petitioners that offence underSection 420of the Indian Penal Code is not attracted, this Court feels that the said issue can be raised at the time of framing of charge. Whether the charge can be framed underSection 420of the Indian Penal Code or not is to be decided by the Court at the time of framing of charge. Merely, because cognizance has been taken for the offence underSection 420of the Indian Penal Code, it cannot be said at this stage that the Court will try the petitioners for the charge underSections 420of the Indian Penal Code, rather, the petitioners will be tried only for the charge which will be framed against them under particular penal section(s).

 6. Counsel for the petitioner submits that the informant is in the habit of lodging false cases against this petitioner. He submits that the petitioner wants to keep his wife with proper dignity, but, she does not want to stay with this petitioner. 
 7. I have heard the counsel for the parties and have gone through the records including the First Information Report. I find that the petitioner, being the husband, tortured and assaulted the informant, who is the wife. Further a demand of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakh) as dowry was made. On earlier occasion, Mahila Police Station Case No.76 of 2016 was registered-: 2 :-for offences underSections 498/34,323,328/34of the Indian Penal Code andSections 3/4of the Dowry Prohibition Act, but, as the petitioner and the informant compromised, the said case was withdrawn. It has also been mentioned that after withdrawal of the said case, wife was taken to matrimonial house, but, again after torture and assault, the present first information report has been lodged. The aforesaid allegations definitely make out an offence.

 For the Petitioner : Mr. A.K. Kashyap, Sr. Advocate For the State : Mr. Anup Pawan Topno, A.P.P. 
 ------- 
 02/15.09.2020 Heard Mr. A.K. Kashyap, learned senior counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Anup Pawan Topno, learned A.P.P. for the State. 
 The petitioner has prayed for grant of anticipatory bail, as he is apprehending his arrest in connection with Bariatu P.S. Case No. 231/2019. 
 It has been alleged that the petitioner had tried to take illegal possession of the land purchased by the son of the informant. He had demanded a sum of Rs. 12,00,000/- as extortion money and on 29.09.2019 the accused persons had entered into the campus and on the next day the boundary wall was demolished. 
 It has been stated by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner is a social worker and since he had raised the issue with respect to the illegal occupation of an Adavasi land by the informant he has falsely been implicated in the present case at the behest of the informant as well as by the builder. Learned senior counsel further submits that with respect to the said land a suit is already pending in which the informant as well as the builder is a party. So far as the antecedents of the petitioner is concerned learned senior counsel submits that in most of the cases the petitioner has been acquitted or final report has been submitted and the petitioner at present has one criminal antecedent being an accused in Bariatu P.S. Case No. 168/2019 which is also with respect to a trivial offence. 
 Mr. Anup Pawan Topno, learned A.P.P. for the State has opposed the prayer for anticipatory bail made by the petitioner. 
 It appears that the dispute seems to be with respect to a land which was purportedly purchased by the informant and which is a non-transferable land to a general person. It also appears that a title suit being Title Suit No. 391/2019 is pending in which the informant, the claimant of the land as well as the builder are parties. 
 In view of the attritional relationship which is existing between the informant, the builder as well as the petitioner apart from Gopal Tirkey who claims the said land the false implication of the petitioner cannot be ruled out. 
 In such view of the matter, therefore, the petitioner is directed to surrender before the learned court below within a period of four weeks and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Ranchi in connection with Bariatu P.S.

 2. This case was listed/supposed to be listed before the Lawazima Board for seeking an order in respect of the defects, pointed out by the office. 
 3. Considering the pandemic situation where the Court has minimized the footfall of the lawyers and their clerks in the Court, this Court felt proper to get all the cases listed before this Court so that the defects can be looked into at this stage only. Thus, this case is listed today before the Court directly. 
 4. Defect(s) as pointed out by the office, stand ignored for the present. 
 5. With the consent of the parties, the matter is taken up for hearing on merits. 
 6. The petitioner has challenged the order dated 18.3.2019 passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, Deoghar in G.R. No. 1338 of 2015, whereby the discharge application has been dismissed. He has also challenged the revisional order dated 1.8.2019 whereby, Criminal Revision No. 102/2019 has also been dismissed. 
 7. The petitioner is an accused for the offence underSections 279,291,323,341,354,379,458,385,504,511and34IPC. The police filed chargesheet against the petitioner. The petitioner thereafter, filed an application underSection 239Cr.P.C praying therein to discharge him from the offence, as alleged. The said application was taken up by the court below on 18.3.2019 and final order was passed dismissing the discharge petition. 
 8. While I go through the order dated 18.3.2019, I find that the same is cryptic and non-speaking as no reason has been assigned as to why the discharge petition is being dismissed. Merely dismissing the petition of the petitioner on the ground that the chargesheet has been submitted and cognizance has been taken is not an ground to dismiss the discharge application. Through the court has mentioned about some paragraphs i.e. Paragraphs Nos. 2, 5, 6 and 25 of the case diary but has not mentioned what those paragraph is all about and what are the materials there to frame charge. What are the materials which makes out the case for framing charge against the accused, has not been mentioned. The revisional court has also not mentioned as to what are the materials against the petitioner. Thus, both the impugned orders are liable to be set aside. 
 9. In that view, impugned orders i.e. order dated 18.3.2019 passed in G.R. No. 1338 of 2015 and the revisional order dated 1.8.2019 passed in Criminal Revision No. 102/2019 are set aside. The matter is remitted to the court below to pass a fresh order in accordance with law. 
 10. Accordingly, this petition is allowed."

 Apprehending their arrest, the petitioners have moved this Court for grant of privilege of anticipatory bail in connection with Mihijam P.S. Case No.136 of 2018 (G.R. No. 64 of 2020) registered undersections 406/420/34of the Indian Penal Code. 
 The Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the allegation against the petitioners is that the petitioners accompanied the co-accused -Jitendra Singh and approached the informant to take C&F of Shree Sunshine Brand and the informant paid Rs.12,50,000/- to the co-accused -Jitendra Singh but the petitioners and the co-accused cheated the informant and committed criminal breach of trust. It is further submitted that there is no allegation of entrustment of money to the petitioners and police after due investigation submitted final form against the petitioners and did not send them up for trial but the learned Magistrate has taken cognizance for the offences punishable undersection 406/420/34of the Indian Penal Code against the petitioners also. It is next submitted that the allegation against the petitioners are false and there is no allegation of any dishonest intention of the petitioners at the time of alleged entrustment of money to the co-accused. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioners be given the privilege of anticipatory bail.

 Considering the submissions of the counsels and the fact as discussed above, I am of the opinion that it is a fit case where the above named petitioners be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. Hence, in the event of their arrest or surrender within a period of four weeks from the date of this order, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned S.D.J.M., Jamtara, in connection with Mihijam P.S.

So far as the defects No. 3, 4 and 9(1) are concerned, learned counsel for the petitioner undertakes to remove the same once the situation normalizes. As regards the rest defects, as pointed out by the office, are concerned, the same are ignored. 
 The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Narayanpur P.S. Case No. 24 of 2020. 
 It has been alleged that the minor daughter of the informant was enticed away by Ajay Kumar Mandal and the petitioner and others were suspected to have facilitated the enticement. 
 In the 164Cr.P.C. statement of the victim, it has been state that she was having a friendship with Ajay Kumar Mandal and on account of the said friendship both have eloped. 
 Mrs. Niki Sinha, learned APP has stated that the petitioner has got one criminal antecedent being involved in a case of cybercrime. 
 However, so far as the present case is concerned, the 164Cr.P.C. statement of the victim does not utter a single word about the involvement of the petitioner. It therefore appears that the petitioner has been implicated merely on suspicion. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The petitioner accordingly is directed to surrender before the learned trial court within four weeks from today and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jamtara in connection with Narayanpur P.S.

 02/15.09.2020 Heard Mr. Pran Pranay, learned counsel for the petitioners and Mr. Prabir Kr. Chatterjee, learned Spl. P.P. for the State. 
 Mr. Pran Pranay, learned counsel for the petitioners seeks permission to withdraw this application so far as the petitioner no. 2 is concerned. 
 Permission is accorded. 
 This application stands dismissed as withdrawn as against petitioner no. 2. 
 So far as the petitioner no. 1 is concerned he is apprehending his arrest in connection with Jasidih P.S. Case No. 142/2020. 
 One tractor with trailer loaded with illegally extracted sand was intercepted and seized. 
 The petitioner no. 1 appears to be the owner of the seized tractor and trailer. Admittedly the petitioner no. 1 was not present at the place of occurrence and has been roped in only on account of the fact that he is the owner of the seized tractor and trailer and since it has been stated by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the vehicle was entrusted to the driver for its day-to-day activities, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner no. 1. The petitioner no. 1 accordingly is directed to surrender before the learned court below within a period of four weeks and on such surrender, he shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Deoghar in connection with Jasidih P.S.

 5/15.09.2020 The lawyers have no objection with regard to the proceeding, which has been held through video conferencing today at 11.15 A.M. They have no complaint in respect to the audio and video clarity and quality. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner prays to ignore the defect and take up the matter on merits. 
 Defects stand ignored. 
 Heard the parties. 
 The petitioner, in this application, has challenged the order dated 22.11.2019, by which processes underSection 82Cr.P.C. has been issued against him. 
 After going through the impugned order, I find that the same is non-speaking and cryptic. No satisfaction of the court has been recorded in the impugned order. No reason has been assigned while passing the impugned order issuing process underSection 82Cr.P.C. In absence of any reason and satisfaction, the order impugned is rendered bad in law. 
 Thus, the impugned order dated 22.11.2019, passed by the Additional Sessions Judge-VI-cum-Special Judge SC/ST Act, Dhanbad, in SC/ST Case No. 27/2019, issuing process underSection 82Cr.P.C. against the petitioner, is hereby set aside. The matter is remitted to the court below to pass a fresh speaking order, recording the satisfaction, in accordance with law and in terms of the judgment, passed by this Court in the case of ""Md.

 Order No.02 Dated- 15.09.2020 Heard the parties through video conferencing. Learned counsel for the petitioner personally undertakes to remove the defects as pointed out by the stamp reporter within two weeks after the lockdown period is over. 
 In view of the personal undertaking of the learned counsel for the petitioner, the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter are ignored for the present. 
 Apprehending his arrest, the petitioner has moved this Court for grant of privilege of anticipatory bail in connection with Complaint Case No.3225 of 2017 registered undersections 498A/406/34of the Indian Penal Code and under Section 3/4 of D.P. Act. 
 Let notice be issued to the opposite party no.2 under registered cover with A/D as well as under ordinary process for which requisites etc. must be filed within two weeks by the petitioner, failing which, this application shall stand dismissed without further reference to the Bench. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is the husband of the complainant and the allegation against the petitioner are all false and are general and omnibus in nature. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 The learned Addl. P.P. opposes the prayer for anticipatory bail. 
 List this case on 05.11.2020. 
 Considering the submissions of the counsels and the fact as discussed above, I am inclined to pass an interim order of anticipatory bail provisionally till 05.11.2020. In case of the petitioner being arrested by the police on or before 05.11.2020, he shall be released on bail provisionally on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five thousand) with two sureties of like amount each to the satisfaction of the officer concerned in connection with Complaint Case No.3225 of 2017 subject to the conditions laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

 In this application, petitioner has prayed to quash the composite order dated 24.03.2020 by which cognizance of the offence punishable underSection 376,504,506/34IPC has been taken and summon has been issued. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the cognizance order is absolutely bad and is a non-speaking order and it does not reflect any subjective satisfaction as to what are the materials to take cognizance against this petitioner. He submits that the requirements ofSections 190&204Cr.P.C has not been dealt with in the impugned order. He is relying upon the judgment of this Court in the case of Amresh Kumar Dhiraj and Ors. Vs. State of Jharkhand &Anr., reported in 2020 (1) JLJR 199. 
 After going through the record, I find that the order is absolutely cryptic and non-speaking and is not in conformity with the judgment passed by this Court in the case of Amresh Kumar Dhiraj and Ors. Vs. State of Jharkhand &Anr., reported in 2020 (1) JLJR 199(Jhr). What are the materials against the petitioner to proceed, has also not been mentioned. Thus, the impugned order dated 24.03.2020 passed by the court below is, hereby, set aside. The matter is remitted to the court below to pass a fresh order in accordance with the provision of law.

 Order No. 02: Dated: 15th September, 2020 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel appearing for the State assisted by learned counsel for the opposite party no. 2. 
 So far as the defect nos. 9(i) to (iv) are concerned, the same are ignored. 
 The petitioner is an accused in connection with Nagri P.S. Case No.226 of 2019 (S.T. No. 201 of 2020).The prayer for bail of the petitioner was earlier rejected by this Court in B.A. No. 3003 of 2020. 
 The only ground for renewal of prayer for bail made by the petitioner is the submission advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner and echoed by the learned counsel for the opposite party no. 2 that the matter has been compromised between the petitioner and the opposite party no. 2 for which reference has been made to a compromise petition filed before the court of learned Additional Judicial Commissioner-I, Ranchi. 
 This is a case undersection 376of IPC and the allegation against the petitioner reveals that the informant was repeatedly subjected to rape by the petitioner. The fact that the case is non-compoundable and therefore, the compromise which has been purportedly effected would have no bearing for consideration for grant of bail to the petitioner. 
 Accordingly, there being no fresh ground to reconsider the prayer for bail of the petitioner, the prayer for bail is rejected once again. 
 However, the trial court is directed to expedite the trial once the normal court work resumes.

 So far as defect no. 5(e) is concerned, learned counsel for the petitioner undertakes to remove the same once the situation normalizes. As regards the rest defects are concerned, the same are ignored. 
 The petitioner is an accused in connection with Sitaram Dera P.S. Case No. 146 of 2019 (G.R. Case No. 189 of 2020 & S.T. Case No. 88 of 2020). 
 The prayer for bail of the petitioner was earlier rejected in B.A. No. 643 of 2020. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner stated that the petitioner has been implicated on account of the dispute relating to Gurudwara Prabandhak Committeee. He has also drawn the attention of the Court to the 164Cr.P.C. statement of the witnesses. Learned senior counsel has stated that the petitioner is in custody since 16.11.2019. 
 Learned counsel for the informant has opposed the prayer for regular bail of the petitioner and has primarily relied upon the rejection order dated 17.03.2020 passed in B.A. No. 643 of 2020. 
 It appears that the material which has come in course of investigation has been considered in B.A. No. 643 of 2020 and accordingly, the prayer for bail of the petitioner was rejected. 
 There being no fresh grounds to reconsider the prayer for bail of the petitioner, I am not inclined to reconsider the prayer for bail of the petitioner. The same is once again rejected at this stage.

 The petitioners have prayed for grant of anticipatory bail, as they are apprehending their arrest in connection with Domchanch P.S. Case No. 05/2020. 
 It has been alleged that Jobraj Singh had caused bodily harm to the informant with arrow and pasuli. The wife of the informant also sustained injuries with similar weapons. 
 The petitioners seem to have been implicated on the allegation of threatening the informant earlier. The First Information Report also reveals about an existing land dispute. The injuries sustained by the informant and his wife can therefore be attributed to Jobraj Singh. 
 In view of the aforesaid, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioners. The petitioners accordingly are directed to surrender before the learned court below within a period of four weeks and on such surrender, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned S.D.J.M., Koderma in connection with Domchanch P.S. Case No. 05/2020, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 This application stands allowed.

 02/15.09.2020 Heard Mr. A.K. Kashyap, learned senior counsel for the petitioner and Ms. Ruby Pandey, learned A.P.P. for the State. 
 The petitioner has prayed for grant of anticipatory bail, as she is apprehending her arrest in connection with Bishrampur P.S. Case No. 64/2019. 
 It has been alleged that when the informant, his wife and son opposed the unloading of bricks in front of their house the petitioner and her husband assaulted them with iron rod. 
 The petitioner also seems to have instituted a case against the informant-party being Bishrampur P.S. Case No. 65/2019 though after the institution of the present case. The son of the informant seems to have sustained injuries on his parietal lobe and had also suffered fracture of hand which were opined to be grievous in nature. However, the First Information Report does not disclose as to whether the petitioner was armed with the said iron rod or not. Moreover, the petitioner appears to be a lady and on consideration of the said facts, the petitioner, named above, is directed to surrender before the learned court below within a period of four weeks and on such surrender, she shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Palamau in connection with Bishrampur P.S. Case No. 64/2019, subject to the conditions as laid down underSection 438(2)of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

 It has been alleged that the petitioners and several accused persons had taken a number of girls to Delhi for providing them work. 
 Although learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that some of the victims had returned back and in their 164Cr.P.C. statements they have not named the petitioners but in view of the fact that they are named in the FIR and were involved in human trafficking of innocent girls from the villages, I am not inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioners.

 The petitioner apprehends his arrest in connection with Nawdiha Bazar P.S. Case No. 35 of 2019. 
 It has been alleged that the petitioner had entered into the house of the informant at night and started molesting her. Petitioner is also alleged to have taken Rs.30,000/- cash and ornaments of the informant. 
 The FIR seems to have been instituted after seven days from the alleged date of occurrence. The wife of the informant had also lodged a case of molestation against the son of the informant. Thus there appears to be a case and counter case between both the sides and institution of the FIR without any reasonable or plausible explanation for such delay creates a doubt over the prosecution case itself. 
 On consideration of the aforesaid facts, I am inclined to extend the privilege of anticipatory bail to the petitioner. 
 Accordingly, the petitioner, named above, is directed to surrender in the court below within a period of four weeks from today and pray for regular bail, and in that event, he will be enlarged on bail, on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- ( Ten thousand only) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st class, Palamau at Daltonganj in connection with Nawdiha Bazar P.S.

 Heard the learned counsel appearing for the respective parties. The defect no.9 (i) & (ii), as pointed out by the office, are ignored. The petitioner is an accused in connection with S.T. No. 52 of 2020 arising out of Mandu (Kuju) P.S. Case No.269 of 2016, pending in the court of learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, Ramgarh. 
 The prayer for bail of the petitioner was earlier rejected by this Court in B.A. No.6579 of 2019. 
 It appears that an order was passed 18.03.2020 by the learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ramgarh by which, cognizance has been taken for the offence underSections 498-Aand306of the Indian penal Code. The First Information Report was instituted underSections 498-Aand306of the Indian penal Code and subsequently,Section 304-Bwas added at the time when the bail application of the petitioner was earlier rejected on 20.11.2019. The petitioner appears to be in custody since 28.03.2019. 
 On considering the period of custody undergone by the petitioner and the chain circumstance as enumerated above, the petitioner, named above, is directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of Additional Sessions Judge-I, Ramgarh in connection with S.T.

 In this application, petitioner has challenged the order dated 30.5.2020 whereby process underSection 82Cr.P.C has been issued. 
 After going through the impugned order, I find that order is cryptic and non-speaking one. The court below has not recorded the subjective satisfaction which is necessary to be recorded while issuing the process underSection 82Cr.P.C. The court below has only mentioned that on 7.2.2020 non-bailable warrant of arrest has been issued and the penal sections are non-bailable in nature. These are not sustainable grounds for issuing process underSection 82Cr.P.C. This Court has passed detailed order in the case of Md. Rustum Alam @ Rustam & Ors. Vrs. State of Jharkhand in Cr.M.P No. 2722 of 2019 covering the issues. The order dated 30.5.2020 is not in conformity with the order passed by this Court in the case of Md. Rustum Alam @ Rustam (Supra). Hence the order dated 30.5.2020 is hereby, set aside. The matter is remanded back to the court below for passing order afresh in accordance with law.

 1. Heard learned counsels appearing for the parties on the point of extension of interim relief. 
 2. Heard Mr. Abhay Mishra, Advocate for the proposed intervenor opposing the prayer. 
 3. The learned Senior counsel for the petitioner refers to the interim orders for which prayer has been made for extension. 
 In WP(C) No.1873 of 2018 this court passed an interim order on 16th July 2018 in the following terms: - 
 ""Considering the submissions made by the counsel for the parties, this Court grants interim order to the extent that till the next date the petitioner be allowed to operate under the supervisory regulatory control of the respondent-Board, who may carry out periodical checks as to the adherence by the petitioner to the aforesaidPollution Control Acts. 
 In WP(C) No.4850 of 2018, this court passed an interim order on 27th September 2018 in the following terms: - 
 ""18. As this court prima-facie finds that the impugned order in this case has been passed in total violations of principles of natural justice therefore in such circumstances this writ petition is being entertained. 
 21. This court further prima-facie finds that the impugned order has serious repercussions on the unit of the petitioner which is a running unit and has caused prejudice to the petitioner on account of violations of principles of natural justice. This court further finds that the balance of convenience is in favour of the petitioner. Accordingly, operation, implementation and execution of the impugned order dated 20.09.2018 (Annexure-19) is hereby stayed till the next date. 
 23. However, this order will not be an impediment for the petitioner if the petitioner chooses to apply for statutory clearance as indicated in the impugned order without prejudice to the contention of the petitioner in this writ petition."" 
 4. The above interim orders have been extended from time to time by this Hon'ble Court and on number of the occasions with the consent of the parties. The matter regarding extension of interim relief pursuant to the present interlocutory applications was heard on earlier occasions and the prayer was opposed by the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board and the learned ASGI representing Union of India also expressed reservations on such prayer ,but today, the learned Advocate General appearing for the State of Jharkhand as well as Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board upon instructions has consented for extension of interim relief, although no such affidavit has been filed. The Union of India has filed an affidavit clearly expressing no objection to extension of interim relief. However, the Union of India in their affidavit has clearly3stated that the matter regarding environmental clearance, which is now pending before the competent authority, does not relate to regularisation of the violations done by the petitioner and it has been submitted that a fresh matter regarding environmental clearance is under consideration by the competent authority for which terms of reference has been issued in the month of August 2020 as annexed with the interlocutory applications and also with the affidavit filed by the Union of India. The learned ASGI has raised objection to the term ""regularisation"", as used by the petitioner in their petition seeking extension of interim relief. The extension of interim relief is not being opposed by the respondents due to the reason that the unit of the petitioner is a running unit manufacturing steel having a large number of employees and the Union of India in their earlier affidavit had taken a stand that closure of this industry would not be in the interest of the country and more so under COVID 19 pandemic situation. However, the learned counsel for the proposed intervenor has strongly opposed the prayer for extension of interim relief. 
 5. I.A. No. 4607 of 2020 and I.A No. 4608 of 2020 seeking extension of interim relief was heard on 04.09.2020 and it was submitted that there were subsequent developments and communication dated 28.08.2020 issued by Union of India to the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board to take action underSection 19of the Environment Protection Act, but the said letter was not on record and admittedly no notice as such was issued to the petitioner pursuant to the communication received from the Union of India. In this background, office was directed to post these cases on 08.09.2020 and the interim orders granted earlier in these cases were extended till 08.09.2020. 
 6. After passing of the order dated 04.09.2020, a copy of the letter dated 28.08.2020 was forwarded to this court by the learned counsel of the Union of India issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India to the Secretary, Department of Environment and Forest, Government of Jharkhand requesting to initiate legal action against the petitioner by invoking4power underSection 15read withSection 19of Environment (protection ) Act, 1986 for the period for which the unit has been in violation. A copy was also marked to the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board. A written note of arguments was also filed by the petitioner after passing of order dated 04.09.2020. Since certain documents were filed after hearing on 04.09.2020, the final order on interlocutory applications seeking extension of interim orders could not be passed on 08.09.2020 and accordingly the matter was adjourned and was directed to be posted on 16.09.2020 and it was left open to the respondents to file their reply and interim orders were extended. On 08.09.2020 it was also submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that one practical difficulty in shutting down the plant is that considerable period of around two months is required for shutting down, failing which, it will cause irreparable damage to the plant and machinery and then to restart the plant, six months is technically required. 
 7. In the aforesaid written note of arguments, it was mainly stated that - 
 i. The plant of the petitioner is being operated under the supervisory regulatory control of the Respondent JSPCB, which has not issued a single notice so far to the petitioner alleging violation or non-compliance with environmental norms. No damage to the environment has been alleged and/or assessed by any competent authority. 
 ii. In the interlocutory applications seeking extension of interim reliefs, the petitioner has placed on record the letter dated 25 August 2020 communication the terms of reference granted by the Violations Committee of the Environment Appraisal Committee (EAC) but there is no direction for closure of the plant. 
 iii. It was expressly recorded in the order dated 27 September 2018 passed in WPC 4850 of 2018 that the application made by the petitioner for statutory clearances such as the forest clearance and the environmental clearance would be ""without prejudice"" and the writ petitioner has not given up its claims or contention, either expressly or impliedly till date including the fact that the steel plant is not situated on a forest land and likewise the petitioner also disputed the assessment of the respondents that5the location of the plant was changed. It was also stated that many criminal cases against the petitioner alleging violation of the provisions ofIndian Forest Actand theForest (Conservation) Act, 1980 on the ground that the petitioner has encroached upon a forest land and no Forest Clearance was obtained by the Petitioner) have been quashed by this Hon'ble Court and the location of the plant was within the knowledge of the ministry at the time of giving environmental clearance. Assuming without admitting that there have been any violations of environmental norms, this is not a case where the original violators are still in control of the plant. This entire exercise of applying for statutory clearances was only to amicably resolve the disputes which have been continuing for a long time. 
 iv. The direction to lodge a criminal prosecution is in the teeth of the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, especiallySection 32A, which was inserted recently only to protect resolution applicants from penal actions. The petitioner company and the new management would be protected by virtue of Section 32A of the IBC. 
 v. The contention on behalf of the intervener-applicant that the petitioner is seeking to get an order of ex post facto approval from this Hon'ble Court is completely misconceived. The case of the petitioner stands on a completely different footing from other cases decided by any other court including by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. It should not be lost sight of that the petitioner was granted an Environmental Clearance in the year 2008, while in the other cases, the plants in question had been operationalised prior to grant of any environmental clearance. It is in that context that the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case ofAlembic Pharmaceutical v. Rohit Prajapati and others, 2020 SCC Online SC 347, observed that the concept of ex post facto approval is antithetical to environmental jurisprudence. 
 vi. The respondents have neither indicated nor brought on record any material to show that there has been such a change in the situation which requires vacation of the interim order or discontinuance of the same. 
 vii. The petitioner has been bought over by new management under the aegis of the Vedanta Group at a cost of Rs. 5320 crores with a further investment of Rs. 600 crores by way of de- bottlenecking and process improvements, of which Rs. 80 crores have been spent only on environmental measures. viii. The consequences of discontinuing the interim orders and bringing the plant to a grinding halt would be the following: 
 (a) At a stage when India's GDP has come down by 23.9% in the first quarter of FY2020-21, the nation and the State of Jharkhand would lose Rs. 4200 crores worth of steel production (which has increased from Rs. 3000 crores under the old management due to better practices and better pricing after new management took over). 
 (b) The petitioner's steel plant has 3000 employees on its rolls and a further 7000 contractual employees. In addition, the livelihoods of over 30,000 persons in the transport and logistics sector, suppliers of raw materials and inputs, etc., is dependent on the plant. When their families are taken into account, the number of persons whose livelihoods would be severely compromised by loss of jobs due to shutting the plant, especially during the Covid pandemic, would be massive. 
 (c) The petitioner is paying about Rs. 800 crores in taxes to the State of Jharkhand and to the Government of India, by way of GST and other taxes. This would also adversely affect the ability of the State and the Union to fund social services as well as the development of infrastructure. 
 (d) The petitioner's plans to invest an additional Rs. 5000 crores to expand the plant from 1.5 MTPA to 3 MTPA would also be severely compromised. 
 8. After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, this court finds as under. 
 9. WP(C) No. 1873 of 2018 was filed initially seeking a direction upon the respondents to issue formal consent to operate the plant for the period from 01.01.2018 to 31.12.2022 for which, application with all requisites was submitted to the respondent - State Pollution Control Board on 24.08.2017. 
 10. In the writ petition, I.A. No. 4322 of 2018 was filed which was listed on 16.07.2018. On that day, it was submitted by the petitioner that the application for renewal of consent to operate under the provision of Air (Prevention andControl of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Water (Prevention andControl of Pollution) Act, 1974, was pending before the respondent No. 1 since 24.08.2017 but no final order was passed and it was valid till 31.12.2017. It was submitted that on the7one hand the application was kept pending and on other hand, the petitioner was facing difficulty in running its Unit and under the provisions of law, the application was to be disposed of within a period of four months. 
 To the aforesaid submissions made on 16.07.2018, the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 submitted that there was no difficulty in taking decision on the application which was filed by the petitioner and counsel had received instructions that a final decision on that application can be taken within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of that order and she could not dispute the fact that the Unit of the Petitioner cannot be made to suffer on account of non-disposal of their application which was pending since 2017 as stated above. 
 11. In the aforesaid back ground the following interim order was passed on 16.07.2018: - 
 ""After hearing counsel for the parties and after considering the materials on record, this Court finds that admittedly the consent which was granted to the petitioner expired on 31.12.2017 and the application for consent was made on 24.08.2017 but no order has been passed on the same till date and accordingly, as on date, the consent to operate is not available to the petitioner. This Court finds that the petitioner cannot be made to suffer on account of non-action on the part of the respondent-Board. Accordingly, this Court directs the respondent-Board to take a final decision on the application filed by the petitioner as back as on 24.08.2017, within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt/ production of a copy of this order and bring the order which may be passed on record by filing an affidavit. 
 Considering the submissions made by the counsel for the parties, this Court grants interim order to the extent that till the next date the petitioner be allowed to operate under the supervisory regulatory control of the respondent-Board, who may carry out periodical checks as to the adherence by the petitioner to the aforesaidPollution Control Acts."" 
 12. In the order dated 16.07.2018 it was also observed that from perusal of letter dated 18.12.2017 at Annexure-7, it appeared that a letter had been issued by the Jharkhand State Pollution Control8Board to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Govt. of India, New Delhi, that one show-cause was issued as back as in the year 2012 but final outcome was not known to the Jharkhand Pollution Control Board. In view of the letter, the Union of India, through Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India, was made party respondent in the case, and it was observed that the newly added respondent, Union of India may file their counter-affidavit within a period of four weeks. The matter was adjourned and directed to be posted on 24.08.2018 and interim order was granted till 24.08.2018. It was this interim order which was extended from time to time. 
 13. Thereafter one I.A. No. 7610 of 2018 was filed by the petitioner for amendment of the writ petition being W.P. (C) No. 1873 of 2018 challenging the order dated 21.08.2018 which was passed by the respondent No. 1 during the pendency of the case refusing to grant 'Consent to Operate' to the petitioner on the ground that the environmental clearance given to the petitioner by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change was not yet withdrawn. It was submitted that the matter was pending before the Ministry and the order which was passed by the Pollution Control Board was inter-related. The Union of India had made specific statement that pursuant to show cause issued to the petitioner dated 06.06.2012 they were in a position to take final decision in the matter. In view of certain allegations made in the counter affidavit, the petitioner had submitted that without prejudice to their rights and contentions, the petitioner was intending and willing to file appropriate application before the respondent no. 3 i.e. Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India, New Delhi for regularization of any irregularity which might have been committed by the petitioner in connection with location of plant of the petitioner or in connection with the allegation made against the petitioner. 
 Vide order dated 25.08.2018, the petition for amendment of the writ petition being I.A. No. 7610 of 2018 challenging the order dated921.08.2018 passed by the State Pollution Control Board was allowed. So far as the extension of interim relief is concerned, following order was passed which reads as under: 
 ""10. So far as interim relief is concerned, this court finds that the order passed by the respondent-Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board dated 23.08.2018 appears to be directly dependent on the final decision which is yet to be taken by the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change on the show cause issued to the petitioner as back as in the year 2012. As per the submission made by the counsel appearing on behalf of Union of India, they are shortly going to take a final decision in the matter after hearing the petitioner. Accordingly, the operation, implementation and execution of the order dated 23.08.2018 passed by Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board is hereby stayed till 27.09.2018 and the interim order dated 16.07.2018 is hereby extended till 27.09.2018."" 
 14. This court finds that the aforesaid interim order staying the operation, implementation and execution of the order dated 23.08.2018 passed by Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board, refusing to grant consent to operate was not extended on 27.09.2018 and it lost its force after 27.09.2018. In fact, on 27.09.2018, only the interim order dated 16.07.2018 was extended till 10.10.2018. Thus, even in absence of any interim order with regards to consent to operate, the petitioner continued to operate by virtue of interim order dated 16.07.2018. 
 15. The final order was passed by the Union Ministry and communicated to the petitioner vide letter dated 20.09.2018 indicating that the competent authority of the union government had decided to revoke the environmental clearance which was ordered to the petitioner vide letter dated 21.02.2008 with immediate effect in accordance withSection 5of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 with a further direction that the petitioner may apply for environmental clearance afresh after clearing all the issues as per rule. 
 16. Thus, the main grievance of the petitioner in the writ petition being WP(C) No. 1873 of 2018 that the consent to operate could not be denied to the petitioner during the pendency of the show cause issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change as back as in the year 2012 did not survive any longer by virtue of final decision taken to revoke the environmental clearance which was ordered to the petitioner vide letter dated 21.02.2008 with immediate effect as a result of the aforesaid show cause issued in the year 2012 . 
 17. However, the said communication dated 20.09.2018 was challenged by the petitioner in another writ petition being W.P. (C) No. 4850 of 2018. The said writ petition was taken up by this court on 27.09.2018 and on that day the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Union of India had raised preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the writ petition but the writ petition was entertained as this court prima-facie found that the impugned order was passed in total violation of the principles of natural justice. The case was tagged with W.P. (C) No. 1873 of 2018 and while considering the interim relief, following order was passed on 27.09.2018: - 
 ""21. This court further prima-facie finds that the impugned order has serious repercussions on the unit of the petitioner which is a running unit and has caused prejudice to the petitioner on account of violations of principles of natural justice. This court further finds that the balance of convenience is in favour of the petitioner. Accordingly, operation, implementation and execution of the impugned order dated 20.09.2018 (Annexure-19) is hereby stayed till the next date. 
 23. However, this order will not be an impediment for the petitioner if the petitioner chooses to apply for statutory clearance as indicated in the impugned order without prejudice to the contention of the petitioner in this writ petition."" 
 18. Thereafter the following developments had taken place: - 
 A. On 05.11.2018 it was submitted that the petitioner had chosen to apply for statutory clearance without prejudice to the contention of the petitioner in the writ petition and11substantial progress had taken place. Upon this, the learned Advocate General of the State of Jharkhand had submitted that on the next date of hearing, he may bring on record the present status of the application of forest diversion proposal which was said to have been filed by the petitioner. The matter was directed to be posted on 11.12.2018 and interim orders of the two cases were extended. 
 B. Thereafter on 11.12.2018 a joint prayer was made by the learned counsel for the parties to finally dispose of the matter and it was agreed that they would advance their argument on 08.01.2019 and the matter was directed to be posted for 'Final Disposal' on 08.01.2019 and interim orders passed in both the cases were extended till 08.01.2019. 
 C. The date of final hearing was extended and fixed on 23.01.2019 and it was also observed that the proceeding will commence on 23.01.2019 at 10:30 A.M. and if not concluded on 23.01.2019 the matter will continue on 24.01.2019 and interim orders passed in both the cases were extended only till 23.01.2019. 
 D. Thereafter on 23.01.2019, a submission was made by the learned Advocate General appearing on behalf of the State of Jharkhand that the proposal for afforestation given by the petitioner was under active consideration and it was submitted by the learned Assistant Solicitor General of India appearing on behalf of the Union of India that if the proposal is sent by the State, they will immediately take steps and it is likely to take three months' time for a final decision from the date of receipt of the proposal. Considering this aspect of the matter, the matter was adjourned till 16.05.2019 and with the consent of the parties the interim order dated 16.07.2018 passed in W.P. (C) No. 1873 of 2018 and interim order dated1227.09.2018 passed in W.P. (C) No. 4850 of 2018 were directed to be extended till 16.05.2019. 
 E. On 16.05.2019, it was submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner that the matter was at the advanced stage .The matter was adjourned and was directed to be posted on 25.07.2019 and the interim orders were also extended. 
 F. On 25.07.2019, it was submitted by the Union of India that proposal for obtaining forest clearance had been received by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change on 20.06.2019 and accordingly it would take some time for the Union of India to take a final decision in the matter. The counsel for the Union of India on instructions had submitted that the proposal was under active consideration of the concerned authority under the aforesaid ministry. The learned Advocate General had also expressed that he had no objection to the extension of the interim relief as because the State Government had forwarded the proposal for forest clearance to Union of India. 
 G. The matter was adjourned to 17.10.2019 considering the intervening Pooja vacation and the Union of India was also directed to file necessary affidavit in order to bring on record the final outcome of the decision relating to pending proposal. On 17.10.2019, it was submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Union of India that matter regarding forest clearance of the unit of the petitioner was under active consideration. It was submitted that at least three months' time would be required for the Union of India to take a final decision. It was submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Pollution Control Board that although a petition for vacating the interim relief had been filed and had been pending before this court, but on account of13subsequent development which was brought on record by the Union of India by filing supplementary affidavit, she did not press the stay vacating petition for the present subject to the condition that the petitioner would comply with all the pollution norms in order to safeguard the interest of the environment. Learned Advocate General appearing on behalf of the State of Jharkhand had also submitted that at that stage he had no serious objection to the extension of interim relief which was prayed for by the petitioner as the interest of the nation was involved. 
 H. The matter was adjourned awaiting the final decision of Union of India and the interim orders were extended till 26.02.2020 subject to the condition that the petitioner would comply to the provisions, norms in order to safeguard the interest of the environment. Thereafter the matter was again adjourned from time to time awaiting the final decision of Union of India and ultimately it was directed to be posted on 04.09.2020. On 04.09.2020, the present interlocutory applications were filed seeking extension of interim relief and the subsequent development/order was brought on record. 
 19. This court finds that major developments have taken place in the month of August 2020 when the Expert Appraisal Committee held its 35th meeting in connection with the proposal of the petitioner which the petitioner had given without prejudice to its contentions before this Court in the writ petition. The said minutes have been brought on record. Minutes of 35th meeting of Expert Appraisal Committee held on 6th-7th August 2020 deals with the proposal involving violation of EIA Notification, 2006. The Observation and recommendation of the EAC in the meeting indicates that the proposal was forwarded by the Industry Sector to Violation sector after approval of the Competent Authority to take appropriate action on the application submitted by the petitioner vide proposal dated1403.03.2020 which was considered by the EAC (Violation sector) in the said meeting. The EAC after detailed deliberations appraised the proposal on merit and confirmed the case to be of violation of the EIA Notification , 2006 , recommended for issuing Standard Terms of Reference, applicable to such project and directed that the State Government/SPCB to take action against the project proponent under the provisions of section 19 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and further no consent to operate to be issued till the project is granted EC. 
 20. This Court finds that the fresh proposal which was submitted by the petitioner without prejudice, has culminated in issuing Standard Terms of Reference, applicable to such project under violation of the general condition no. (ii) of the EC dated 21.02.2008 and also violation of the provisions of the EIA Notification, 2006 and it is alleged that the unit of the petitioner is located 5.3 k.m. from the above original co-ordinate i.e. 23 ""40' N & 86 ""20' E as mentioned in the EIA report without the prior approval of the ministry. After observing the violations specific directions have been issued to the State Government/SPCB to take action against the project proponent under the provisions ofsection 15and19of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and further no consent to operate is to be issued till the project is granted Environmental clearance. A follow up letter to this direction has also been issued. 
 21. As stated in the interlocutory applications for extension of interim order, as per the recommendation with regard to terms of reference as a result of aforesaid 35th meeting of Expert Appraisal Committee for Violation Sector held on 06th - 07th August, 2020, the petitioner appointed a consultant and it would require at least six months' time to complete the process. Though, in the interlocutory application, the petitioner has repeatedly used the term ""regularization"" but the Union of India has objected to this term and has submitted that there is no concept of regularisation in case of environmental clearance in view of the judgement passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in 2020 SCC OnLine SC 34715(Alembic Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Vs. Rohit Prajapati and Others"" , there can be no question of post-facto clearance . 
 22. This Court finds that neither terms of reference nor the observations/directions contained therein nor the follow-up letter dated 28.08.2020 are subject matter of challenge before this Court and if the interim orders granted by this Court are extended, the same would amount to staying the directions contained in the terms of reference as well as the follow-up letter dated 28.08.2020. If the said allegation regarding location of the unit of the petitioner is correct then the petitioner has been operating without any environmental clearance and if any environmental clearance is ultimately given for the unit at the present location , the same cannot operate retrospectively in view of the judgement passed by the Hon'ble Supreme court reported in 2020 SCC OnLine SC 347 (Alembic Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Vs. Rohit Prajapati and Others"", wherein it has been held as under: 
 ""27. The concept of an ex post facto EC is in derogation of the fundamental principles of environmental jurisprudence and is an anathema to the EIA notification dated 27 January 1994. It is, as the judgment in Common Cause holds, detrimental to the environment and could lead to irreparable degradation. The reason why a retrospective EC or an ex post facto clearance is alien to environmental jurisprudence is that before the issuance of an EC, the statutory notification warrants a careful application of mind, besides a study into the likely consequences of a proposed activity on the environment. An EC can be issued only after various stages of the decision - making process have been completed. Requirements such as conducting a public hearing, screening, scoping and appraisal are components of the decision-making process which ensure that the likely impacts of the industrial activity or the expansion of an existing industrial activity are considered in the decision-making calculus. Allowing for an ex post facto clearance would essentially condone the operation of industrial activities without the grant of an EC. In the absence of an EC, there would be no conditions that would safeguard the environment. Moreover, if the EC was to be ultimately refused, irreparable harm would have been caused to the environment. In either view of the matter, environment law cannot countenance the notion of an ex post facto clearance. This16would be contrary to both the precautionary principle as well as the need for sustainable development."" 
 23. This court also finds that in the said judgement the Hon'ble supreme court by invokingArticle 142of the Constitution of India passed certain directions taking a balanced approach and prevented closure of the industry. 
 24. This Court also finds that while issuing the terms of reference , the concerned authority had also taken into consideration the fact that the NCLT vide order dated 17.04.2018 under Section 31(1) of the IBC approved the Resolution Plan submitted by the Vedanta Limited for the petitioner vide its order dated 10.08.2018 and consequently, Vedanta Limited had acquired 90% equity shareholding in the petitioner company with effect from 04.06.2018 and also reconstituted the Board of Directors of the petitioner company. Admittedly, the directions and findings of terms of reference contained in communication dated 25.08.2020 and the follow-up letter dated 28.08.2020 are not under challenge. 
 25. In such circumstances the interim orders which have continued so far, cannot be extended as the same would amount to staying the directions contained in aforesaid communication dated 25.08.2020 and follow-up letter dated 28.08.2020 wherein a clear direction has been issued to the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board not to issue consent to operate the unit of the petitioner which is said to have been situated 5.3 KM away from the spot for which environmental clearance was earlier given to the petitioner and subsequently cancelled. It appears at this stage that the unit at its present location has been operating without any environmental clearance ever issued to the petitioner in view of the aforesaid communication dated 25.08.2020 
 26. Accordingly, this court is not inclined to extend the interim orders passed by this Court in view of the aforesaid judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. 
 27. At this stage, the learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner has strenuously submitted that some time space may17be given as they intend to move the Hon'ble Supreme Court against this order and if the unit of the petitioner comes to a grinding halt in absence of interim order, the petitioner would suffer irreparable injury. He has submitted that it may be observed that the interim orders granted earlier would cease to operate with effect from a later date. 
 28. To this submission, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Union of India as well as the learned Advocate General representing the State of Jharkhand and Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board have no serious objection. 
 29. Consequently, I.A. No. 4608 of 2020 in W.P.(C) No. 1873 of 2018 and I.A. No. 4607 of 2020 in W.P.(C) No. 4850 of 2018 are hereby dismissed with a direction that the interim orders granted earlier would cease to operate on and from 23.09.2020. 
 30. Since the matter was fixed for final arguments today, the Court had asked the learned senior counsel for the petitioner to commence the arguments in the present cases, but the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner has prayed for adjournment as the petitioner proposes to move the Hon'ble Supreme Court against this order refusing to extend the interim relief. 
 31. Accordingly, post these cases on 04.11.2020 under appropriate heading in view of the intervening Durga Pooja vacation. 
 32. It will be open to the parties to use the web copy of the present order on account of Covid-19 situation.

 CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ANIL KUMAR CHOUDHARY 
 ------ 
 Heard the parties through video conferencing. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner personally undertakes to remove the defects as pointed out by the stamp reporter within two weeks after the lockdown period is over. 
 In view of the personal undertaking of the learned counsel for the petitioner, the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter are ignored for the present. 
 Apprehending his arrest, the petitioner has moved this Court for grant of privilege of anticipatory bail in connection with Patan P.S. Case No.38 of 2019 registered undersections 384/389/406/420/34/120Bof the Indian Penal Code. 
 The Learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioner submits that the Water Ways Division, Medininagar, in the district of Palamau floated a tender for executing work of Extension, Restoration and Modernization of Jinjoy irrigation scheme under the district of Palamau for Rs.35,18,11,422/- with a mandatory condition that only the firm and contractor who has earlier experience of a single work done worth 50% of the said value of the Rs. 35,18,11,422 /- would be eligible to submit the bid. It is next submitted that the petitioner being the partner of M/s S.S. Infrastructure Co., has forged documents with intention to cheat Water and Irrigation Department, Medininagar by furnishing a forged and fabricated document of past experience of having constructed a Anikat (Check dam) over Mand river vide tender no.1797 and the claiming worth of the said work to be 18,65,50,000/- though in fact, the said work was for 3,40,00,000/-. It is also alleged that the petitioner being the partner of M/s S.S. Infrastructure Co. gave part of the said work to the informant as subcontract for Rs.3,50,00,000/- but the petitioner has cheated the informant by not paying the amount. It is next submitted that the informant earlier filed writ petition being W.P. (C) No.3087 of 2018 and a coordinate Bench of this Court vide order dated 06.08.2018 dismissed the writ petition by observing that the informant herein who was the petitioner in the said writ petition, has not averred in the writ petition that the informant participated in the tender in question and if the work in question is wrongly being awarded by the State in favour of the petitioner of this anticipatory bail application, the informant cannot be said to have been aggrieved hence, the informant has no locus standi to maintain the said writ petition and dismissed the same. It is also submitted that in view of the said observation of the coordinate Bench of this Court, the complainant has no locus standi to file the complaint which upon being forwarded underSection 156(3), this FIR has been registered. It is next submitted that the informant is involved in several criminal cases and the firm of the petitioner has completed 95% of the work. It is also submitted that though it has been wrongly mentioned in paragraph no.12 of this anticipatory bail application that M/s S.S. Infrastructure Co. is a company but in fact, the same is a partnership firm. It is next submitted that there is no agreement between the parties as averred in paragraph no.11 of the complaint and the dispute between the parties is basically a civil dispute. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned Addl. P.P. and the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the informant opposes the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail and submitted that there is serious allegation against the petitioner of forging of documents in collusion with the Executive Engineer, Water Ways Division, Medininagar and other persons in the higher echelon of the Government by facilitating the petitioner and his firm to defraud the State of Jharkhand of huge amount of money by getting the said work allotted to the petitioner though he was not even eligible to participate in the said tender, for not fulfilling the eligibility criteria of having earlier experience of a single work done worth 50% of the said value of the Rs. 35,18,11,422 /-. It is next submitted that during investigation the witnesses have stated about illegality committed by the petitioner as part of wider conspiracy and during investigation it was also found by police that the petitioner has paid much less income tax than the tax he was supposed to pay for the work he claims to have carried out. It is next submitted that as the petitioner is not cooperating with the investigation of the case hence, process underSection 82Cr.P.C. was issued against him though the same has been quashed by a coordinate Bench of this Court in criminal miscellaneous petition, but the I.O. of the case found his house to be locked on several occasion during the course of investigation. It is then submitted that in view of the serious nature of allegation, custodial interrogation of the petitioner is required during the investigation of the case. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioner ought not to be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 So far as the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner regarding the locus standi of the informant to file the complaint which led to registration of this FIR is concerned, the same is without any merit; 
 Firstly because it is a settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that anyone can set or put the criminal law into motion except where the statute enacting or creating an offence indicates to the contrary. The schemeof the Codeof Criminal Procedure envisages two parallel and independent agencies for taking criminal offences to court. Even for the most serious offence of murder, it was not disputed that a private complaint can, not only be filed but can be entertained and proceeded with according to law. Locus standi of the complainant is a concept foreign to criminal jurisprudence save and except that where the statue creating an offence provides for the eligibility of the complainant, by necessary implication the general principle gets excluded by such statutory provision as has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case ofA.R. Antulay v. Ramdas Sriniwas Nayak, (1984) 2 SCC 500(Paragraph -6); and Secondly because in the complaint the informant has alleged that he was cheated interalia by the petitioner personally also. 
 Considering the serious nature of allegation against the petitioner of being in conspiracy with the officers and others persons in the higher echelons of the state government having defrauded the state government of huge amount of money and the requirement of his custodial interrogation during the investigation of the case, this Court is of the considered view that this is not a fit case where the petitioner be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. Accordingly, his prayer for anticipatory bail is rejected.

 For the Central Silk Board : Mr. Indranil Bhaduri, Adv. 
 --- 
 12/16.09.2020 Heard learned counsel for the writ petitioners, the Union of India and the respondent- Central Silk Board. 
 Being aggrieved by the order dated 16th February 2017 passed by learned Central Administrative Tribunal, Circuit Bench, Ranchi in O.A. No.214/2013(R), the applicants have approached this Court underArticle 226of the Constitution of India. 
 The applicants had moved the learned C.A.T. for the following reliefs :- 
 ""The direction should be given to the Respondents Authority to enhance/up-grade/revise the pay scale of the two cadres of Scientists, i.e. Senior Research Officer (also called Assistant Director) and the Deputy Director into the next higher scale with effect from 01.01.1996 irrespective to their length of service in the light of up- gradation / revision of the pay scale of the Scientists working in the other cadres such as the Scale of the Senior Research Assistant (hereinafter referred as to 'SRA'), the Joint Director and the Director have been up-graded/revised, but the pay scale of Senior Research Officer (SRO) and the Deputy Director has not been up-graded/ revised in the same terms in which the pay scale of the Scientists of other cadre has been revised/ upgraded."" 
 Learned C.A.T. considered the stand of both the parties and declined to entertain the matter also taking note that prior to 5th Central Pay Commission, pay scale of Joint Directors were in the higher pay scale than the Deputy Directors and the Deputy Directors were feeder cadre for Joint Directors. The implementation of 5th CPC merged the two pay scales into one. The authorities examined the anamoly on the demand of CSB Scientists and the Joint Directors were accordingly given the higher pay scale. There was nothing perverse in the matter. Learned C.A.T. acknowledged that the issues regarding classification of posts and determination of pay structure comes within the exclusive domain of the executives and the Tribunal cannot sit in appeal over the wisdom of the executives in prescribing certain pay structure and grade in a particular service. It referred to the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Hukum Chand Gupta Vs. DG, ICAR & Ors. (2012) 12 SCC 666 and also in the case of Union of India through Department of Post and Telegraph Vs. T.V.L.N. Mallikarjun Rao & Ors. (2015) 3 SCC 653. The case of Union of India Vs. P.V. Hariharan (1997) 3 SCC 568 was also taken note of. 
 Briefly stated, the case of the applicants/writ petitioners, as pleaded before the learned C.A.T. and in the instant writ petition is that the organization has, in a discriminatory manner, not given the revisional benefits to Senior Research Officer and Deputy Directors which has resulted in loss of pay in grant of grade and uniform designation of the scientific and technical post covered by the flexible complementing scheme under notification dated 9th November 1998 issued by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievance and Pension. They have contended that being in the post of Senior Research Officer and Deputy Director, they are also entitled for equal treatment in revision of scale as per letter dated 30th June 1999 and correct designation of the Scientist grades. They contend that the pay revision implemented by CSB by letter dated 30th June 1999 is not at par with the CSIR which amounts to denial of equality and parity. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners, in order to portray the exact comparative picture of revision in pay scales implemented under 5th pay revision w.e.f. 1.1.1996 in the Central Silk Board and further revised by the Ministry of Textiles vide letter no.25012/73/87- Silk dated 16th June 1999 have referred to the two charts under para-3 of the counter affidavit which is also extracted herein below for better appreciation of the case of the parties :- 
 ""3. That in the meantime, the pay scales of the Central Government employees were revised by the Central Govt. based on the recommendations of the V Central Pay Commission w.e.f 1-1-1996. Subsequently, the revised pay scales were also made applicable to Autonomous Bodies like the Central Silk Board w.e.f 1-1-1996. The revised pay scales granted to the CSB scientists based on their pre- revised pay scales as per the recommendations of the V CPC were as under: 
 During June 1999, the Ministry of Textiles vide letter No.25012/73/87-Silk dated 16th June 1999 approved a pay package for the CSB Scientists as per details given below with retrospective effect from 1.1.1996:- 
 Drawing from comparison between the aforesaid two tables, learned counsel for the petitioners has urged that the revision in pay scale of Senior Research Officer, Deputy Director and Joint Director in particular w.e.f. 1.1.1996 under 5th CPC entailed the revised pay scale of Rs.8,000- 
 13,500/-, 10,000-15,200/- and 10,000-15,200/- respectively to the officers of these respective cadres. However, the decision taken on 16th June 1999 given retrospective effect from 1.1.1996 resulted in a serious pay anomaly for the reason that scale of pay at Rs.8,000-13,500/- of Senior Research Officer and that of Deputy Director in the scale of Rs.10,000-15,200/-, remained the same, while that of Joint Director was upwardly revised to Rs.12,000-16,500/- . If the pay anomaly was revised by the Ministry of Textiles for the CSB Scientists by its decision dated 16th June 1999, the anomaly in respect of the pay scale of the Senior Research Officer and Deputy Director also ought to have been revised. 
 Be it observed at this stage that the decision of Ministry of Textiles dated 16th June 1999 (Annexure-B to the counter affidavit) is not under challenge before this Court neither was assailed before the C.A.T. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the decision dated 16 th June 1999 gave the Scientist pay scale to the cadre of the Central Silk Board. Petitioners have also sought to draw strength from the order of the High Court of Karnataka in Writ petition Nos. 2536-2634/1997 dated 14th February 1997 (Annexure-C to the counter affidavit of Central Silk Board) and upheld by the learned Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka vide judgment dated 29th July 1997 in Writ Appeal No. 3762 & 3823-3920/1997 Learned counsel for the respondents, in particular, has referred to para-7 of the judgment passed by the learned Single Judge of the Karnataka High Court at Annexure-C where it had refused to go into the question whether the petitioners are entitled to seek implementation of the recommendation made by the respondent Board so far as their pay structure is concerned. The only direction that was given was to consider the representation, if any, made by the petitioners therein within a stipulated period. 
 The Central Silk Board through its counter affidavit has justified the pay revision implemented by the Ministry of Textiles order dated 16th June 1999 implemented w.e.f. 1.1.1996 on the ground that the pay revision effected w.e.f. 1.1.1996 by the CSB resulted in an anomaly since scale of Deputy Director and Joint Director got equated, though those two posts were different and the post of Joint Director was the promotional post of Deputy Director with a different scale of pay in the pre-revised scale also. Apart from that, learned counsel for the respondent has also submitted that the cadre of Senior Research Assistant was declared as a dying cadre. As and when the present incumbents in that cadre completed 10 years of service, they were placed in the pay scale of Rs.8,000-13500/-in the cadre of Senior Research Officer. All the future appointments were being made in the scale of Rs.8,000-13,500/- on the post of Senior Research Officer. Learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that a bare perusal of the first table under para-3 would show that the pre-revised scale of pay of all these cadres: Senior Research Assistant, Senior Research Officer, Deputy Director, Joint Director and Director were different. However, on implementation of the revised pay scale, though the cadre of Senior Research Assistant and Senior Research Officer had revised scale of Rs.5,500-9,000/- and 8,000-13,500/- but that of the Deputy Director and Joint Director were revised but on the same scale of pay of Rs.10,000- 15,200/- which resulted in the anomaly. This has been corrected by the decision dated 16th June 1999 which has not been challenged before the learned CAT or in this writ petition. While correcting the anomaly a post of Senior Director was also created in the pay scale of Rs.16400-20000/-. In the present set of pay scales under 5th PRC each cadre is in a different scale in the climbing order of hierarchy and therefore the plea of equality or parity in treatment or discrimination on the part of the applicants/writ petitioners have rightly been declined by the learned CAT. 
 We have heard learned counsel for the parties and taken into note the relevant material facts and documents on record relied upon by them. We have also gone through the impugned order of learned CAT. 
 At the outset, it needs to be reiterated that the decision dated 16 th June 1999 of Ministry of Textiles regarding the pay scale of Central Silk Board Scientists which, in particular, has aggrieved the applicants/writ petitioners have nowhere been challenged either before the learned CAT or this Court. On the other hand, the applicants had moved the learned CAT with a simple prayer for enhancement or upgradation or revision of their pay scale of two cadres of Senior Research Officer and Deputy Director w.e.f. 1.1.1996. 
 From consideration of the materials on record and, in particular, the comparative tables extracted at para-3 of the counter affidavit above, we do not find that the decision dated 16th June 1999 taken by the Ministry of Textiles in respect of revision of pay scale of the Scientists of the Central Silk Board suffered from any illegality or discrimination vis-à-vis the cadre of these petitioners. The learned CAT also found that there has been no discrimination in grant of revised pay scale to the petitioners' cadre as unequals cannot be treated alike. Respondents have filed a detailed affidavit justifying the rectification of the pay scale of the Joint Director to Rs.12,000- 16,500/- as they were erroneously equated in pay scale with the Deputy Directors while 5th CPC was implemented in CSB w.e.f. 1.1.1996. It is also evident that the post of Deputy Director is lower to that of the Joint Director and in fact is a feeder cadre. The A.C.R. of the Deputy Directors are written by the Joint Director. 
 In the facts and circumstances discussed above and the reasons recorded, we do not find any error in the order of learned CAT calling for interference underArticle 226of the Constitution of India. The writ petition, being devoid of merit, is dismissed.

 through Video Conferencing. Concerned lawyers have no objection with regard to the proceeding, which has been held through Video Conferencing today at 10:30 A.M. onwards. They have no complaint in respect to the audio and video clarity and quality. 
 Apprehending their arrest, petitioners have filed the instant application for grant of anticipatory bail in connection with Loyabad P.S. Case No. 47 of 2019, for the offence underSection 392IPC. 
 Mr. Rohan Mazumdar, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that petitioners are innocent and have not committed any offence as alleged in the FIR, rather, they have been falsely implicated in the present case. From perusal of the FIR it appears that accused Niranjan Yadav had stanched the cell phone of the informant but the name of the petitioners are not mentioned in the FIR and no prima facie case underSection 392of IPC is made out against the petitioners. Learned counsel further argues that there is delay of three days in lodging the FIR since the occurrence took place on 03.08.2019 but the FIR was lodged on 06.08.2019. Learned counsel further argues that the petitioners and the respondents have settled their dispute and good relationship has been restored between them and the informant does not want to proceed further any proceeding against the petitioners. 
 Mr. Anjani Kumar Toppo, learned APP vehemently opposes the contention of the petitioners. 
 In the facts and circumstances, since the informant and petitioners have settled their disputes amicably, I am inclined to enlarge the petitioners on bail. 
 Hence, in the event of arrest by the police or surrender before the Court below within a period of four weeks from today, the petitioners named above shall be enlarged on bail on furnishing bail bonds of Rs.20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand) each, with two sureties of the like amount each, to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Dhanbad, in connection with Loyabad P.S.

 Learned counsel for the petitioners undertakes to deposit the deficit court fee including other fee/stamp as soon as the present situation prevailing due to outbreak of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic normalizes. 
 At the request of learned counsel for the petitioners, rest of the defects, as pointed out by the office, are ignored. 
 The petitioners are apprehending their arrest for the offences punishable underSections 147,148,149,336,337,332,333,353,307,504,506,379of the Indian Penal Code andSection 54of the Mines and Minerals (Development andRegulation) Act. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners have been falsely implicated in the present case and have not committed any offence as alleged in the first information report. The petitioner no.1 is the registered owner of the truck bearing registration no.JH18 E 6685 and the petitioner no.2 is the registered owner of the truck bearing registration no. JH18 E 2209. As per the F.I.R., about 50-60 trucks overloaded with stone chips were apprehended by the joint team of the officers of the different departments of Sahebganj district which got escaped after the local people pelted stones over the government officers. It is further submitted that list of the said allegedly escaped trucks appended with the F.I.R. would suggest that the petitioners' trucks which have been mentioned at Serial Nos.194 and 196 were empty. In fact, the entire story regarding escape of the apprehended trucks has been concocted by the authorities. The petitioners have no criminal antecedents against them as has been stated in paragraph 13 of the present anticipatory bail application. Hence, the petitioners may be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned A.P.P. opposed the petitioners' prayer for anticipatory bail. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and considering the facts and circumstances of the case, I am inclined to grant anticipatory bail to the-2-petitioners. Accordingly, the petitioners above named, are directed to surrender before the concerned court below within four weeks from today. In the event of their arrest/surrender before the concerned court below within the aforesaid period, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.20,000/-(Rupees Twenty Thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the court of learned Sub- Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Sahebganj in connection with Mirzachouki P.S.

 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has been falsely implicated in the present case and has not committed any offence as alleged in the complaint leading to lodging of the F.I.R. underSection 156(3)of the Cr.P.C. It is further submitted that in fact the father-in- law of the petitioner is the registered owner of the land in question. However, the informant was making construction over the said land only after making payment of token amount which was objected by the petitioner and his family members. Due to the said reason, a complaint petition was filed in pursuance of which the F.I.R. was lodged underSection 156(3)of the Cr.P.C. Admittedly, no injury has been caused to the informant in the alleged occurrence. Hence, the petitioner may be given the privilege of anticipatory bail.

 Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners have been falsely implicated in the present case and have not committed any offence as alleged in the first information report. Even if the content of the written report of the informant is taken to be true, the only allegation against the petitioners is that they were present at the place of occurrence along with the other co-accused persons. There is specific allegation of making assault upon the head of the informant by means of iron rod against co- accused Golu Rai. So far as the petitioners are concerned, there is no allegation of such overt act against them. Hence, the petitioners may be given the privilege of anticipatory bail.

 The petitioners apprehending their arrest in connection with Chas (M) P.S. Case No. 31 of 2020 registered underSections 414/34of the Indian Penal Code, have prayed for grant of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners have been falsely implicated in the present case and have not committed any offence as alleged in the F.I.R. On perusal of the F.I.R., it would be evident that the petitioners along with co-accused Vijay Kumar were arrested by the police at the spot on 19.05.2020 itself, however surprisingly they were neither produced before the court nor any explanation was given in that regard. In fact, the recovery of the coal was made from a common place in the village and the motorcycles of the accused persons lying in front of their houses were seized. The entire allegation made by the informant in the written report is false and concocted. Hence, the petitioners may be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned A.P.P. opposes the petitioners' prayer for anticipatory bail. Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstance, I am inclined to enlarge the petitioners on anticipatory bail. Accordingly, the petitioners, above named, are directed to surrender before the concerned court below within four weeks from today.

 The petitioner apprehending his arrest in connection with Kanke P.S. Case No. 80 of 2020 registered underSections 420/406/341/323/34/506of the Indian Penal Code, has prayed for grant of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has been falsely implicated in the present case and has not committed any offence as alleged in the F.I.R. It has been alleged against the accused persons including the petitioner that they had taken JCB machine bearing registration no. JH02AK-1285 from the informant on rent, however the accused persons paid Rs.85,000/- only against the due amount of rent payable to him. It has also been alleged in the F.I.R. that the said J.C.B. machine was made to disappear by the accused persons. Learned counsel for the petitioner while referring the paragraph-8 of the present anticipatory bail application submits that on 11.05.2020, the informant along with police came to the petitioner's house and forcibly took away the said JCB machine. Even if the entire allegation made in the written report of the informant is taken to be true, it is the matter of civil dispute. Hence, the petitioner may be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned A.P.P. opposes the petitioner's prayer for anticipatory bail. 
 Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstance, I am inclined to enlarge the petitioner on anticipatory bail. Accordingly, the petitioner, above named, is directed to surrender before the concerned court below within four weeks from today.

There was a love marriage between informant and son of the petitioners. The allegations are vague, baseless and general in nature.

 Mr. Sandip Kumar Burnwal, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that petitioners are innocent and have not committed any offence as alleged in the FIR and they have been falsely implicated in the instant case. Learned counsel further argues that there is no specific allegation against the petitioners and all the allegations are omnibus. Learned counsel further argues that only because of the land dispute, the petitioners were dragged in the instant case. It is a case of civil dispute and criminality has not been attracted. 
 Mr. Shailesh Kumar Sinha, learned APP vehemently opposes the contention of the petitioners and submits that allegations against the petitioners is of forming unlawful assembly and assaulting the informant's wife and as such, the petitioners are not entitled for the privilege of anticipatory bail.

 Mr. Vijay Shankar Prasad, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that petitioners are innocent and have not committed any offence as alleged in the FIR and they have been falsely implicated in the instant case. Learned counsel further argues that nothing has been recovered from the conscious possession of the petitioners and from perusal of the seizure list it appears that prohibited meat of bovine animal has been recovered from the possession of Bablu Quraishi, Minhaj Quraishi and Bhola Quraishi, who have been granted anticipatory bail by this Court vide order dated 18.04.2019, passed in A.B.A. No. 1817 of 2019.

 Mr. Vikash Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that petitioners are innocent and have not committed any offence as alleged in the FIR, rather, the FIR has been lodged on the basis of false and concocted story. Learned counsel further argues that the petitioners have been made accused on the basis of confessional statement of co-accused, which has no evidentiary value in the eyes of law. Further, the co-accused, namely Tapan Mahato has already been granted anticipatory bail by this Court vide order dated 26.10.2016, passed in A.B.A. No. 2829 of 2016 and the petitioners also deserve the same benefit.

Apparently, the sand was found on the land of Onga Pahan and Binay Kharia but the police has not made them accused in this case and just to save those land owners, police is trying to make the innocent persons as accused. Further, no one saw the petitioner committing the offence of theft of the sand from river hence, no offence underSection 379IPC is made out and other offences are bailable.

Learned counsel for the State has further submitted that driver, Deepak Sahu has been enlarged on regular bail, as such, petitioner does not deserve to be enlarged on anticipatory bail on such frivolous plea. After some argument, learned counsel for the petitioner seeks permission to withdraw this application. 
 Permission is granted. 
 Learned counsel for the State has no objection. 
 Accordingly, the instant anticipatory bail application is dismissed as withdrawn.

 Order No.02 Dated- 16.09.2020 Heard the parties through video conferencing. Learned counsel for the petitioners personally undertakes to remove the defects as pointed out by the stamp reporter within two weeks after the lockdown period is over. 
 In view of the personal undertaking of the learned counsel for the petitioners, the defects pointed out by the stamp reporter are ignored for the present. 
 Apprehending their arrest, the petitioners have moved this Court for grant of privilege of anticipatory bail in connection with Complaint Case No.35 of 2018 registered undersections 467/468/471/420/34of the Indian Penal Code whereby cognizance has been taken undersection 420of the Indian Penal Code. 
 The Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the allegation against the petitioners is that the petitioners have gifted land of the complainant to the Governor, State of Jharkhand for construction of a pond. It is, further, submitted that the allegation against the petitioners are all false and the land belongs to the ancestor of the petitioners and in this respect, the learned counsel for the petitioners draws attention of this Court to annexure-3 series. It is next submitted that the petitioners are not enjoying that land and the complainant has no right, title or interest over the said land and only to harass the petitioners who are the public spirit citizens, this false case has been foisted. It is then submitted that the dispute between the parties is basically a civil dispute. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioners be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned Addl. P.P. opposes the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail. 
 Considering the submissions of the counsels and the fact as discussed above, I am of the opinion that it is a fit case where the above named petitioners be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. Hence, in the event of their arrest or surrender within a period of six weeks from the date of this order, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate -1st Class, Giridih, in connection with Complaint Case No.35 of 2018 subject to the conditions laid down under section 438 (2) Cr.

 Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners have been falsely implicated in the present case and have not committed any offence as alleged in the F.I.R. It is alleged that more than 500 persons belonging to two different communities raised slogans against each other and disturbed the communal harmony in the area. They also pelted stones and damaged few vehicles standing there. It is further submitted that except the hearsay statements, the police has not yet collected any cogent evidence against the petitioners to connect them with the alleged offence despite lapse of more than two years from the date of lodging of the F.I.R. Hence, the petitioners may be given the privilege of anticipatory bail. 
 Learned A.P.P. opposes the petitioners' prayer for anticipatory bail Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstance, I am inclined to enlarge the petitioners on anticipatory bail. Accordingly, the petitioners, above named, are directed to surrender before the concerned court below within four weeks from today. In the event of their arrest/surrender before the concerned court below within the aforesaid period, they shall be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.20,000/- (twenty thousand only) each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the S.D.J.M., Giridih in connection with Giridih (M) P.S.

 Mr. Kamdeo Pandey, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that petitioner is innocent and has not committed any offence whatsoever. The petitioner has been implicated in the present case merely on the basis of suspicion and with malafide intention of the informant. Nothing has been recovered from the possession of the present petitioner and further, the seizure list does not bear the signature of petitioner and his family members, rather, the witnesses are police personnel and as such, it shows the falsity of the entire prosecution case. Petitioner has no concern with the seized liquor and as such, no case is made out u/s 47(A) of Excise Actagainst this petitioner. Petitioner has no criminal antecedent and there is no chance of absconding or tampering with the evidences. 
 Mr. Ashok Singh, learned APP vehemently opposes the contention of the petitioner.

 Hence, in the event of arrest by the police or surrender before the Court below within a period of four weeks from today, the petitioner named above shall be enlarged on bail on furnishing bail bonds of Rs.20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand), with two sureties of the like amount each, to the satisfaction of learned Judicial Magistrate, Giridih, in connection with Bagodar P.S.
