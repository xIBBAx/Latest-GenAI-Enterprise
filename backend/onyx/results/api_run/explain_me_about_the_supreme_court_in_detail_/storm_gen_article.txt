# Overview

A supreme court, also known as a court of last resort, apex court, or high court of appeal, is the highest court within a legal jurisdiction's hierarchy of courts [1]. Generally, supreme court decisions are binding on all other courts within that jurisdiction [1]. The primary function of a supreme court is to interpret the constitution and make decisions on important cases that have implications for the nation [2]. It ensures that laws and government actions align with the principles of the constitution [2].
The Supreme Court of the United States was established in 1789 [3]. The power to nominate Justices is vested in the President of the United States [4]. The Supreme Court consists of the Chief Justice of the United States and a number of Associate Justices fixed by Congress; currently, there are eight Associate Justices [4]. The judgments about the Constitution are value judgments [5]. The Supreme Court has played a major role in defining the parameters of governments' powers [6]. The Court's rulings can have a significant impact on American society [7].
The Supreme Court of India is the interpreter of the provisions and the controller of the entire judicial system of India [8]. Article 124 of the Indian constitution elaborates on the Supreme Court [8]. The Supreme Court is primarily a court of appeal and hears appeals against the judgments of High Courts [9][10]. The Supreme Court of India has original, appellate, and advisory jurisdiction [10].
