# summary

A supreme court, also known as a court of last resort, apex court, or high court of appeal, is the highest court within a legal jurisdiction's hierarchy of courts.[1] Generally, the decisions of a supreme court are binding on all other courts within that jurisdiction, establishing legal precedent and ensuring consistent application of the law.[1] These courts play a crucial role in shaping the legal landscape of a nation.
The primary function of a supreme court is often to interpret the constitution and make decisions on important cases with broad implications for the nation.[2] This includes ensuring that laws and government actions align with the principles of the constitution, safeguarding individual rights, and resolving disputes between different branches of government or levels of jurisdiction.[2] The power and specific responsibilities of a supreme court are typically defined by the constitution or legal framework of the country it serves.
Examples of prominent supreme courts include the Supreme Court of the United States, established in 1789, which plays a major role in defining the parameters of governmental powers and whose rulings have a significant impact on American society.[3][4][5] The Supreme Court of India, established under Article 124 of the Indian Constitution, serves as the interpreter of the constitution and controller of the entire judicial system of India, possessing original, appellate, and advisory jurisdiction.[6][7][8]
The selection of justices for a supreme court is a critical process, often involving political considerations, as the judgments rendered are frequently based on value judgments and can significantly influence the direction of a nation's legal and social policies.[9] In the United States, for example, the power to nominate Justices is vested in the President.[10] The composition and philosophical leanings of a supreme court can therefore be a subject of considerable public and political debate.
