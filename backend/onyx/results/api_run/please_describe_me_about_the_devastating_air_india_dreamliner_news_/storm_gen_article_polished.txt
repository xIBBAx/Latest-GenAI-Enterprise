On June 12, 2025, Air India Flight 171, a scheduled international passenger flight operated by a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner (registration VT-ANB), crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad Airport (AMD) in India, en route to London Gatwick Airport (LGW) [1][2][3][4]. The crash, considered one of India's deadliest aviation disasters, resulted in a high number of fatalities, with initial reports indicating at least 240 deaths, later revised to 274, though one passenger miraculously survived [5][6]. The flight carried 242 passengers and crew, including a significant number of Indian and British nationals [7][8].
The crash prompted immediate responses from Indian and international aviation authorities. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) of India launched a formal investigation, with assistance from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) [9][10][11][12][13]. Investigators are focusing on potential causes, including engine failure, mechanical issues with the wing flaps and landing gear, and possible electrical system malfunctions [14][15][16][17]. The recovery of the flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), commonly known as the "black boxes," is expected to provide crucial insights into the events leading up to the crash [18][19].
The incident has had a wide-ranging impact, sparking concerns about airline safety and leading to increased anxiety among the public regarding air travel [20][21]. The Indian Ministry of Civil Aviation ordered safety inspections of Air India's fleet, particularly those with GE Aerospace GEnx engines, resulting in flight reductions to Europe and North America [22][23][24][25]. The crash has also brought renewed scrutiny to Boeing and the 787 Dreamliner, with investigators examining potential manufacturing issues and past safety warnings [26][27].
The investigation is ongoing and expected to take a year or more to complete [28]. Safety recommendations are anticipated to arise from the findings, potentially addressing manufacturing processes, maintenance protocols, pilot training, and aircraft design [29][30][31]. The aftermath of the crash includes significant insurance claims and concerns raised by family members of the victims [32][33].

# Incident Details

On June 12, 2025, Air India Flight AI171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner en route from Ahmedabad to London, crashed shortly after takeoff from Sardar Vallabhbhai Airport in Ahmedabad [43][44]. The crash marked the first fatal incident for the 787 Dreamliner [43][45]. The aircraft was carrying 242 passengers and crew [46], though some reports indicate 274 fatalities [47]. Only one person survived the crash [44]. The crash site was described by local residents as a scene of widespread damage [48][49].

# Investigation

Following the crash of Air India flight AI-171 near Ahmedabad on June 12, 2025, a formal investigation was launched by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), a division of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Government of India [11][12][13]. The AAIB's primary objective is to prevent future accidents and incidents [50]. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is assisting in the investigation [51].
The investigation is focusing on several key areas, including the Boeing 787's engine thrust, wing flaps, and landing gear [14][15]. Investigators are examining whether the pilots failed to extend the landing gear or if a mechanical failure prevented them from doing so [52]. Initial speculation centered around a possible double engine failure [53], with investigators examining the possibility of the emergency power system, specifically the ram air turbine (RAT), activating before the crash, suggesting engine trouble during takeoff [54][49]. A safety engineering expert suggested the aircraft appeared to have nosedived, indicating potential issues with engine thrust, flaps, or landing gear [55].
Authorities have recovered both the flight data recorder (FDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), commonly known as the "black boxes" [18][19]. Decoding the data from these recorders is expected to provide in-depth insight into the events leading up to the crash [42]. The AAIB will analyze the data to understand the final seconds of the flight [18][19]. Previous AAIB investigations have utilized CVR and FDR data downloaded from an intact EAFR (Exact Approach Fix Runway) [56].
The investigation process involves data collection, analysis, and presentation of findings [57]. The probe will consider potential factors such as engine failure [16], electrical system failure [17], and fuel contamination [58].

# Impact

The crash of Air India Flight 171 on June 12, 2025, has had a wide-ranging impact, affecting the aviation industry, public confidence, and the airline itself. The incident has sparked a "global reckoning over the true state of airline safety" [20].
Following the crash, the Indian Ministry of Civil Aviation ordered safety inspections on Air India's fleet, particularly those with GE Aerospace GEnx engines [22][23]. Subsequent inspections by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) led to Air India reducing its flights to Europe and North America [24][25], with cancellations affecting routes including London, Paris, Vienna, and Dubai [59]. Furthermore, a show cause notice was issued to the accountable manager of Air India for operating flights exceeding stipulated flight time limits [60].
The crash has also led to increased anxiety and a "fear of flying" among the Indian public [21]. Some residents living near the crash site were among the first to respond, assisting with rescue efforts and witnessing the extensive damage [48].
The incident has also brought renewed scrutiny to Boeing, with investigators examining potential manufacturing issues related to the 787 Dreamliner [26][27]. The investigation aims to determine whether the crash was caused by mechanical failure, engine problems, or other factors [61]. Preliminary investigations considered issues related to engine thrust, flaps, and landing gear [15].
