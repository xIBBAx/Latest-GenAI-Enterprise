# Background

On June 12, 2025, an Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, operating as Flight AI171 from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick, crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad [13][14][15]. The crash resulted in the deaths of all 242 people on board [15]. The aircraft involved was a wide-bodied Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which has been in service for 14 years [16][17]. The incident has intensified scrutiny regarding the safety and reliability of the Boeing 787 aircraft [18][19]. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner is considered one of the most modern passenger aircraft in service [3]. Following the crash, investigators are working to decode the black box to gain insights into the events leading up to the accident [20].

# Incident Details

On June 12, 2025, Air India Flight AI171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner en route from Ahmedabad to London, crashed shortly after takeoff from Sardar Vallabhbhai Airport in Ahmedabad [21][22]. The crash marked the first fatal incident for the 787 Dreamliner [21][23]. The aircraft was carrying 242 passengers and crew [24], though some reports indicate 274 fatalities [25]. Only one person survived the crash [22]. The crash site was described by local residents as a scene of widespread damage [26][27].

# Investigation

Following the crash of Air India flight AI-171 near Ahmedabad on June 12, 2025, a formal investigation was launched by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), a division of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Government of India [28][29][30]. The AAIB's primary objective is to prevent future accidents and incidents [31]. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is assisting in the investigation [32].
The investigation is focusing on several key areas, including the Boeing 787's engine thrust, wing flaps, and landing gear [33][34]. Investigators are examining whether the pilots failed to extend the landing gear or if a mechanical failure prevented them from doing so [35]. Initial speculation centered around a possible double engine failure [36], with investigators examining the possibility of the emergency power system, specifically the ram air turbine (RAT), activating before the crash, suggesting engine trouble during takeoff [37][27]. A safety engineering expert suggested the aircraft appeared to have nosedived, indicating potential issues with engine thrust, flaps, or landing gear [38].
Authorities have recovered both the flight data recorder (FDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), commonly known as the "black boxes" [39][40]. Decoding the data from these recorders is expected to provide in-depth insight into the events leading up to the crash [20]. The AAIB will analyze the data to understand the final seconds of the flight [39][40]. Previous AAIB investigations have utilized CVR and FDR data downloaded from an intact EAFR (Exact Approach Fix Runway) [41].
The investigation process involves data collection, analysis, and presentation of findings [42]. The probe will consider potential factors such as engine failure [43], electrical system failure [44], and fuel contamination [45].

# Impact

The crash of Air India Flight 171 on June 12, 2025, has had a wide-ranging impact, affecting the aviation industry, public confidence, and the airline itself. The incident has sparked a "global reckoning over the true state of airline safety" [46].
Following the crash, the Indian Ministry of Civil Aviation ordered safety inspections on Air India's fleet, particularly those with GE Aerospace GEnx engines [47][48]. Subsequent inspections by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) led to Air India reducing its flights to Europe and North America [49][50], with cancellations affecting routes including London, Paris, Vienna, and Dubai [51]. Furthermore, a show cause notice was issued to the accountable manager of Air India for operating flights exceeding stipulated flight time limits [52].
The crash has also led to increased anxiety and a "fear of flying" among the Indian public [53]. Some residents living near the crash site were among the first to respond, assisting with rescue efforts and witnessing the extensive damage [26].
The incident has also brought renewed scrutiny to Boeing, with investigators examining potential manufacturing issues related to the 787 Dreamliner [54][55]. The investigation aims to determine whether the crash was caused by mechanical failure, engine problems, or other factors [56]. Preliminary investigations considered issues related to engine thrust, flaps, and landing gear [34].

# Responses

The crash of Air India Flight AI171, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick, carrying 242 passengers and crew [7], has triggered a wide range of responses. The Government of India immediately responded to the tragedy [57]. First responders, including residents living near the crash site, rushed to provide assistance [26].
The accident is under investigation by Indian accident investigators [11], with the Air Accidents Investigation Bureau (AAIB) taking the lead [58][59]. The AAIB's investigation aims to determine the cause of the crash, whether it was due to mechanical failure, engine problems, or other factors, with the goal of preventing future accidents [60][61][31][62][59][56]. The investigation will involve analyzing flight recorders [56][11].
The incident is expected to result in significant insurance claims [63]. Family members of the victims, including British citizens, have expressed concerns and are seeking answers [64]. Air India has released official statements regarding the incident [65].

# Safety Recommendations

Following the recent Air India Boeing 787 crash in Ahmedabad [50][49], and subsequent inspections by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), safety recommendations are anticipated to arise from the ongoing investigation [66] [67] [68]. The primary objective of any aircraft accident investigation is the prevention of future accidents and incidents [31] [62] [61] [60]. The investigation process typically involves three phases: data collection, data analysis, and presentation of findings [42].
Speculations surrounding the AI 171 crash have intensified, with potential electrical system failure in the Boeing 787 being a key area of focus [44]. Furthermore, investigators are examining past safety warnings from whistleblower John Barnett regarding Boeing 787 Dreamliner manufacturing practices [55]. The investigation will likely explore whether the crash was due to mechanical failure, engine malfunction, or other factors [56]. Given the findings, safety recommendations could address manufacturing processes, maintenance protocols, pilot training, and potential design flaws [46]. Air India has already announced a reduction in flights to Europe and North America following the crash and DGCA inspections [50][49].

# Similar Incidents (if any)

While the Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crash is described as the first-ever crash of that model [69], it is important to note that the provided information does not offer a comprehensive list of similar incidents involving other aircraft or airlines [70]. The investigation into the crash, including decoding the black box, is expected to provide in-depth insights into the cause of the accident [20] [71]. Aviation history demonstrates that accidents are often a result of a combination of factors, including system failures, malfunctions, and human response [46].
