# Overview

Firefox is a web browser, a software application that allows users to access and view web pages on the World Wide Web [1] [2]. Web browsers are fundamental tools for navigating the internet, communicating with web servers, and displaying content to users [1] [3]. They interpret the code of web pages, which are often written using web standards [4] [5], and present the information in a user-friendly format [3].
Key functions of a web browser include retrieving resources from the web, rendering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and providing a user interface for interaction [2] [3]. Modern browsers like Firefox also incorporate features such as fingerprinting protection [6], customizable search settings [7], and security measures to protect users from vulnerabilities [8]. Furthermore, some browsers are integrating AI-powered features to enhance the search experience [9].

# History

The project that eventually became Firefox began as an experimental branch of the Mozilla Suite, known as "m/b" (or mozilla/browser) [10][11][12][13][14]. Created by Dave Hyatt and Blake Ross, it aimed to offer a leaner and faster browsing experience compared to the resource-intensive Mozilla Suite [15][16][17].
The browser underwent several name changes in its early development [14][18][19]. It was initially named Phoenix [20][10][21][18][22][23], with the first version, Phoenix 0.1, released on September 23, 2002 [24][25]. However, a trademark dispute with Phoenix Technologies, a BIOS manufacturer, forced a name change [10][21]. The name was then changed to Firebird, but this too was problematic due to a conflict with another open-source project [26].
Finally, the project was renamed Firefox [27]. Firefox 1.0 was officially released on November 9, 2004 [16][17][28]. Following its release, Firefox quickly gained popularity and began to capture a significant share of the browser market from Microsoft's Internet Explorer [28].

# Features

Firefox, like other web browsers such as Google Chrome [2], allows users to access and navigate the internet by viewing websites [2] [1]. It renders web pages using the Gecko engine, adhering to web standards [29].
*   **Security and Privacy:** Firefox offers advanced and customizable privacy and security features [30]. It is considered one of the safest and most secure browsers available [31]. Firefox incorporates features like sandboxing to isolate potentially malicious programs [32] [33] [34] [35] [36]. Browser sandboxing creates a barrier between the local system and the internet [32]. Furthermore, Firefox implements web security fundamentals such as the Same-Origin Policy [37] [38] [39]. Domain Name System over HTTPS (DoH) improves privacy by hiding domain name lookups [40].
*   **Sandboxing:** Firefox employs sandboxing by utilizing parent and child processes [33] [34]. The parent process manages core functionalities like UI, profiles, navigation, and process selection [41]. Sandboxing helps to prevent attackers from escaping the browser's environment [42] [36].
*   **Web Standards Compliance:** Firefox is designed to comply with web standards, which promote accessibility and interoperability [43] [44] [5] [45] [46] [4] [47] [48] [29]. Web standards help standardize how a website interacts with assistive technologies [43] [44].
*   **Customization:** Firefox offers extensive customization options [30].
*   **Memory Management:** Some users prefer Firefox for its memory usage compared to other browsers [49].

# Technology

Firefox utilizes the Gecko rendering engine to display web pages [29]. This engine is designed to adhere to both current and future web standards [29]. Mozilla actively participates in the development of open web standards and web-related specifications, submitting proposals to standards bodies like the IETF, W3C, WHATWG, and Ecma TC39 [48] [46]. Web standards are crucial for ensuring websites interact effectively with assistive technologies, making the web more accessible [43] [44]. Staying up-to-date with the latest web standards is essential for ensuring compatibility with various web app frameworks and technologies [45]. The browser's development has benefited from collaboration between the open web community and engineers from Mozilla and Google [50].

# Security Vulnerabilities

Mozilla regularly releases security updates to address vulnerabilities found in the Firefox browser [51]. These vulnerabilities can range in severity, with some allowing attackers to potentially escape the browser's sandbox [42] [35] or even gain unauthorized access to systems [52].
Several vulnerabilities have been specifically identified and addressed in recent years. For example, CVE-2024-9680 was a serious security flaw that was reportedly exploited in the wild before a fix was released [53]. In April 2025, CVE-2025-2857 was patched to prevent attackers from escaping the browser's sandbox [42]. Firefox 139 included fixes for vulnerabilities such as a double-free in the libvpx encoder (MFSA-TMP-2025-0001) and error handling issues in script processing (CVE-2025-5263) [54]. Older versions of Firefox were also susceptible to vulnerabilities; for instance, versions before 42.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.4 had multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine that could be exploited by remote attackers [55].
Firefox employs a sandbox to enhance security, utilizing unprivileged user namespaces when creating new processes [35]. However, vulnerabilities can still arise, necessitating constant vigilance and updates from Mozilla [42] [52]. The Inter-Process Communication (IPC) security within Firefox is implemented on a protocol-by-protocol basis, acting as a gateway for many system components [56].

# Usage and Market Share

Soon after its release in November 2004, Firefox 1.0 began to gain a significant portion of the market share from Microsoft's Internet Explorer [28]. This growth was fueled, in part, by Firefox's focus on user empowerment and independence [57]. However, it's important to note that Mozilla, the organization behind Firefox, is largely funded by a dominant search provider [58], which raises questions about its complete independence. Despite this, Firefox's tracking protection features have contributed to its influence in the web standards process [59]. The browser's compatibility with internet standards remains a key concern for users [60], and Firefox strives to stay up-to-date with the latest web standards and ensure compatibility with popular web app frameworks [45][61].

# Reception

Reception of Mozilla Firefox has generally been positive, with users and critics alike praising its features and commitment to open web standards [62][5][60][48][46]. The browser is recognized as a free and open-source alternative to proprietary browsers [18][63][28]. Leadership roles within the Firefox community are often granted based on community activity and the quality of contributions [64].
