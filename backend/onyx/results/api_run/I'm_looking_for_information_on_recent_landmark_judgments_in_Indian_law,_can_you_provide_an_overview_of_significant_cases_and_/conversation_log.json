Cases such as Bilkis Yakub Rasool v. also fall under this category, marking significant precedents [2].\n\nOther Areas: While the provided information does not detail specific landmark judgments in environmental law, it does highlight activity in areas like family law, with High Courts delivering important judgments on topics such as alimony and maintenance, divorce, and child custody [8].

The Supreme Court has also clarified that it can intervene if there is an imminent threat to the violation of Article 21 [6].
