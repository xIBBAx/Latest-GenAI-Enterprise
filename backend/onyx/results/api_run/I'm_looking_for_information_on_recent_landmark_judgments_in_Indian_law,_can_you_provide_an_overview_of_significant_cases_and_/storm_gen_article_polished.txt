**Landmark judgments in Indian law** are significant legal decisions that have reshaped the country's legal landscape in recent years. These rulings, primarily from the Supreme Court of India, clarify existing laws, establish new legal precedents, and play a crucial role in safeguarding fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution.[1][2][3][4] These judgments impact diverse areas, including constitutional law, criminal law, and civil matters.
A key focus of these landmark decisions has been constitutional law, particularly the interpretation and expansion of fundamental rights. The Supreme Court has affirmed the broad scope of Article 21, guaranteeing the right to life and personal liberty,[5][6][7] and has recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right.[8] Furthermore, cases like *Amar Jain V Union of India* have highlighted the importance of inclusive digital access and e-governance in upholding constitutional principles.[9][10]
Criminal law has also undergone significant changes due to landmark judgments. A notable example is the partial striking down of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, decriminalizing consensual homosexual acts in private.[11][12] However, the constitutional validity of criminal defamation under Sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code has been upheld.[13] The continued use of Urdu terminology in court proceedings reflects the historical influence on legal language.[14]
Beyond these areas, landmark judgments have addressed issues such as the independence of the judiciary,[4] reservation policies,[15] and interpretations of the Code of Criminal Procedure.[16] The Supreme Court's ongoing engagement with these critical issues ensures the Constitution's continued relevance and adaptability to contemporary societal challenges.[14]

# Overview of Recent Landmark Judgments in Indian Law

The Indian legal system has witnessed several landmark judgments in recent years that have significantly impacted various aspects of law, ranging from constitutional rights to criminal law and civil matters [1] [2]. These judgments often serve to clarify existing laws, establish new precedents, and ensure the protection of fundamental rights [3] [4].
Several key areas have been the focus of these landmark decisions. Constitutional law has seen significant developments, with judgments addressing the scope of Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) [5] [6] [7], the right to privacy [8], and the intersection of digital access and e-governance [9] [10]. For example, the Supreme Court has affirmed that Article 21 is not limited and that the right to life and personal liberty is broad [6]. The right to privacy has also been recognized as a fundamental right [8].
Criminal law has also been subject to important rulings. Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalized homosexual acts, has been partially struck down, decriminalizing consensual homosexual acts in private [11] [12]. However, the criminal offense of defamation under Sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code has been upheld [13]. The courts also frequently use Urdu terminology, reflecting its historical influence on legal language [14].
Other significant judgments have touched upon diverse areas such as the independence of the judiciary [4], reservations [15], and interpretations of the Code of Criminal Procedure [16]. Recent cases like *Amar Jain V Union of India* have emphasized inclusive digital access [9] [10]. The Supreme Court continues to address critical issues, ensuring the Constitution's relevance in modern society [14].
