# Overview of Recent Landmark Judgments in Indian Law

The Indian legal system has witnessed several landmark judgments in recent years that have significantly impacted various aspects of law, ranging from constitutional rights to criminal law and civil matters [1] [2]. These judgments often serve to clarify existing laws, establish new precedents, and ensure the protection of fundamental rights [3] [4].
Several key areas have been the focus of these landmark decisions. Constitutional law has seen significant developments, with judgments addressing the scope of Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) [5] [6] [7], the right to privacy [8], and the intersection of digital access and e-governance [9] [10]. For example, the Supreme Court has affirmed that Article 21 is not limited and that the right to life and personal liberty is broad [6]. The right to privacy has also been recognized as a fundamental right [8].
Criminal law has also been subject to important rulings. Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalized homosexual acts, has been partially struck down, decriminalizing consensual homosexual acts in private [11] [12]. However, the criminal offense of defamation under Sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code has been upheld [13]. The courts also frequently use Urdu terminology, reflecting its historical influence on legal language [14].
Other significant judgments have touched upon diverse areas such as the independence of the judiciary [4], reservations [15], and interpretations of the Code of Criminal Procedure [16]. Recent cases like *Amar Jain V Union of India* have emphasized inclusive digital access [9] [10]. The Supreme Court continues to address critical issues, ensuring the Constitution's relevance in modern society [14].
