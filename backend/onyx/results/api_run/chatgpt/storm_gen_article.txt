# Overview

ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that utilizes natural language processing to engage in human-like conversational dialogue [1]. Developed by OpenAI, it is based on the GPT-3 architecture, a large language model (LLM) [2][3]. The model is designed to understand and respond to user questions and instructions by learning patterns from vast amounts of data, including text and images [4]. ChatGPT can handle complex queries, engage in sophisticated conversations, and provide contextually relevant information across a wide range of topics [5].
The development of ChatGPT involved several key steps, including supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]. Supervised fine-tuning involves human AI trainers providing conversations in which they play both the user and the AI assistant [7]. RLHF further refines the model's ability to follow human instructions [10].
ChatGPT's capabilities include content creation, customer service, lead generation, social media management, and personalized marketing [14]. It can also assist with tasks such as generating SQL queries from natural language prompts [15][16][17][2]. Furthermore, enhancements have enabled ChatGPT to access real-time information, providing users with up-to-date and contextually relevant responses [18].
However, challenges exist, including the potential for generating misleading or erroneous text, leading to the spread of misinformation [19]. Addressing bias in training data and algorithms is also an ongoing area of focus [20][21][22][23][24][25]. Techniques such as data augmentation, re-weighting training data, and fairness-aware algorithms are employed to mitigate bias [21][23][24][25].

# Capabilities

ChatGPT possesses a range of capabilities stemming from its underlying architecture and training [26][27]. It leverages technologies like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Deep Learning to understand and generate human-like text [27]. The model is built upon a transformer-based neural network architecture [26][28][29][30], which has revolutionized NLP tasks [28].
ChatGPT excels at generating human-like text responses [31], making it suitable for conversational applications [31][32]. It can answer questions [33], generate content [33][30], and even create computer code [33]. The model tracks previous prompts and responses, allowing it to correct and adapt subsequent answers based on the input sequence [33]. This ability to maintain context makes it a powerful tool for creating dynamic and engaging conversations.
The model's capabilities are powered by large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o [34]. These models are trained on vast amounts of online text [1], enabling them to learn the nuances of human language [1]. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) further refines the model's responses to align with human values [35].
ChatGPT's versatility extends to various business applications, including customer support, legal assistance, data analysis, finance, and supply chain management [36]. It can automate routine tasks, enhance data interpretation, and facilitate real-time communication [36]. Furthermore, developers can integrate ChatGPT into their own applications through services like Azure OpenAI Service [37][38]. OpenAI also provides resources, tutorials, and API documentation to help developers leverage the platform effectively [39].
While powerful, ChatGPT also has limitations [40]. Addressing fairness and bias is an ongoing effort, involving diverse training data, fairness-aware algorithms, user interface design considerations, external audits, and continuous monitoring [20]. Despite these challenges, ChatGPT represents a significant advancement in conversational AI [29]. Smaller, optimized models like OpenAI's o4-mini offer cost-efficient reasoning capabilities, achieving high performance in areas like math, coding, and data science [41].

# Limitations

ChatGPT, while powerful, has several limitations that users and developers should be aware of. These limitations span from factual inaccuracies to ethical concerns and biases.
One significant limitation is the tendency of ChatGPT to generate plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers [7]. This can be attributed to the lack of a definitive "source of truth" during reinforcement learning (RL) training [7]. Training the model to be more cautious can also cause it to decline answering questions it is capable of answering correctly [7]. Supervised training can mislead the model because the ideal answer is dependent on the model's existing knowledge [7]. This phenomenon can lead to the spread of misinformation [19].
Bias is another critical limitation. ChatGPT can reproduce biases, including sexism and political biases, from its training data [42]. This occurs because the model generates responses similar to what it has been trained on [42]. Gender bias has been particularly noted in large language model (LLM) responses [43], and studies have explored ethnic and gender bias in applications such as job applicant assessment [44]. Mitigation techniques include adversarial training, data augmentation, and re-sampling [21]. Data debiasing techniques, such as data augmentation and filtering, can also be used to reduce biases from training data [24][25]. Re-weighting training data is another strategy to mitigate bias [23]. It's important to note that some consider bias in LLMs to be potentially inevitable [43].
Ethical risks associated with ChatGPT include compromised data privacy, biased inputs, inaccuracies, misleading results, unreliability, and plagiarism [45][46][47]. The use of AI in scientific writing also raises concerns regarding research and publication ethics [48].
Furthermore, there are limitations regarding the context and data the model can access. There are distinctions between training data, context data, and query data, each with its own token limitations [49].

# Development

ChatGPT's development is rooted in the advancements of artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP), particularly with the evolution of large language models (LLMs) [50]. OpenAI's GPT series of models, including ChatGPT, have gained considerable attention for their ability to generate human-like text and engage in conversational interactions [50].
The architecture of GPT models, including those powering ChatGPT, is based on the transformer model [51]. The transformer architecture excels at processing sequential data and has revolutionized NLP due to its ability to handle long-range dependencies in text and its efficiency in training on large datasets [52] [51] [53]. Transformers utilize a mechanism called self-attention (or multi-head attention) to understand the relationship of each word in a sentence with all other words [54] [55]. This self-attention mechanism uses Key, Query, and Value (QKV) to determine the pairwise similarity between tokens, mimicking a search procedure [56] [57].
The development of ChatGPT has involved several iterations and improvements. GPT-3.5, released in 2020, served as the foundational language model for the original ChatGPT [50]. OpenAI has also released the GPT-3.5 Turbo API for developers [58] [39]. Later models include GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo, with GPT-4 being recognized for its ability to handle complex tasks [59]. OpenAI also released the reasoning model OpenAI o1 in 2024, which generates long chains of thought before providing a final answer [60]. Smaller, more efficient models like OpenAI o4-mini and GPT-4o mini have also been developed, optimized for speed and cost-efficiency [41] [61]. As of early 2025, GPT-4.5 (Orion) represents OpenAI's latest advancement in non-chain-of-thought processing [62].
The initial GPT model, GPT-1, was introduced in 2018 and consisted of 117 million parameters, trained using the BooksCorpus dataset [63] [51] [64]. GPT-1 utilized a 12-layer decoder-only transformer structure with masked self-attention [65] [66]. The development of these models involves training on vast amounts of data from various sources [4].
However, the development of ChatGPT and similar LLMs also faces challenges, including the potential for biases in the generated text [43]. Developers actively seek diverse perspectives during the development process to avoid such biases [67]. Techniques such as re-weighting training data and fairness-aware algorithms are employed to mitigate bias [23] [20] [24].
