# Overview

Sapphire is a gemstone variety of the mineral corundum, consisting of aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) with trace elements such as iron, titanium, chromium, vanadium, or magnesium [1]. The name "sapphire" is derived from the Greek word "sappheiros," which originally referred to blue stones, including lapis lazuli [2].
Rough sapphires can sometimes resemble ordinary pebbles, requiring experience to identify [3]. Once recognized, further evaluation is possible [3]. Sapphires are valued for their color, with color being a primary determinant of value [4]. Clarity is another important factor [4].
Sapphires exhibit a phenomenon called pleochroism, where the color appears to change depending on the viewing angle in doubly refractive gems [5][6]. This variation in color is due to the gem's interaction with light [5].
Gem cutting styles, which refer to the shape and arrangement of facets, significantly impact a sapphire's appearance [7]. The three basic styles are brilliant, step, and mixed cuts [7]. There are also unique sapphire size charts to help understand the various cuts [8].
In gemology, internal imperfections are referred to as inclusions [9]. These inclusions can sometimes indicate whether a gem has undergone treatments [9]. For example, "lily pad" inclusions are associated with peridot, while discoid inclusions are found in sapphire [10].
A notable variety is the Padparadscha sapphire, also known as "Padmarag" in Sanskrit [11]. This term describes sapphires with pink, orangish-pink, golden-pink, or golden-red hues [11][12]. Distinguishing between pink sapphire and ruby can be challenging [12].

# Properties

Sapphire, a variety of corundum, is an aluminum oxide mineral with the chemical formula Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> [13][14][15][16][17]. It belongs to the trigonal (rhombohedral) crystal system, though it is often treated as hexagonal [18][19]. The crystal structure is characterized by a hexagonal arrangement [20][17]. Sapphire's defining properties include its exceptional hardness, rating 9 on the Mohs scale [21][22][2][23]. This makes it a very durable and scratch-resistant material [21][24][25][26].
Other key physical properties of sapphire include:
*   **Density:** 3.
*   **Melting Point:** 2040-2053 °C [27][28]
*   **Refractive Index:** Approximately 1.76 in the visible spectrum [29][30]. Specifically, nω = 1.767-1.772 and nε = 1.759-1.763 [31][32].
*   **Birefringence:** 0.008-0.
*   **Optical Transmission Range:** 0.17 - 5.
*   **Crystal Structure:** Hexagonal-rhombohedral [33][26]
*   **Hardness (Mohs):** 9 [21][22][2][23]
*   **Tensile Strength:** 300 to 400 MPa [26]
Sapphire is also known for its chemical inertness and corrosion resistance [21][25][34]. It is insoluble in water [27]. Sapphire can withstand extreme environmental conditions, including high temperatures and pressures [24]. However, at high temperatures (e.g., 1000°C), it may react with other materials like zinc oxide (ZnO) [35]. As an anisotropic crystal, some of its properties, such as hardness and thermal expansion, can vary depending on the crystal orientation [19][36].
The color of sapphire is influenced by trace elements within the aluminum oxide structure [14][37]. For example, the presence of chromium, iron, and titanium can result in a range of colors from light blue to intense blue [37][38]. Some sapphires exhibit color change under different lighting conditions, typically appearing blue-violet in daylight and purple or reddish under incandescent light [39]. This phenomenon is similar to that observed in alexandrite and is due to specific chemical compositions [39]. Color is a significant factor in determining the value of a sapphire gemstone [40][4].

# Occurrence

Sapphires are formed from the mineral corundum (Al₂O₃) under specific geological conditions involving high temperature and pressure [41]. These conditions are typically found in metamorphic and magmatic environments [42] [43].
The formation of sapphires often occurs in metamorphic rocks during cataclysmic tectonic events, such as continental collisions that form mountain ranges [44] [45]. The Highland Complex of Sri Lanka, which contains high-grade metamorphic rocks, is a prime example of a region where sapphires are likely to form [46]. Sapphires can also be found in alluvial gem gravel deposits, where they have been transported from their original source rocks by erosion [43].
In magmatic environments, sapphires can crystallize from melts [47]. Some sapphires are hosted in igneous dikes, with evidence suggesting they may have formed in the Earth's mantle [48]. These rocks are often undersaturated, meaning they lack free quartz [17].
Gem corundum deposits are distributed globally and can develop in various geological environments [49]. Recently, gem-quality blue sapphires have been discovered in spinel-chlorite-muscovite rock within meta-ultramafites near the Ilmenogorsky alkaline complex [50]. Sapphires have also been found in situ in primary rocks in Greece [51].

# Varieties

Sapphire, a variety of the mineral corundum (aluminum oxide, Al2O3) [52][41][16], is well-known for its blue hues but also occurs in a wide spectrum of other colors [53][41][54][55]. While "sapphire" typically refers to the blue variety [53][56], any other color of corundum besides red (which is ruby) is also considered a sapphire [57]. These non-blue sapphires are often called "fancy sapphires" [40][53].
Color is a primary factor in determining a sapphire's value [58][4][59][60], with the most coveted shade being a deep, velvety blue [61]. However, "fancy sapphires" come in pink, orange, yellow, green, purple, and violet [40]. The strength and saturation of the color significantly influence its value [40][62]. The color in sapphires arises from trace amounts of elements like iron, titanium, chromium, vanadium, and magnesium within the aluminum oxide structure [41][63][32]. For example, iron can lead to yellow sapphires, while vanadium can produce purple sapphires [63].
Specific varieties of sapphire include:
*   **Blue Sapphire:** The most well-known and highly valued variety [56][16][64]. The most desirable blue sapphires exhibit a velvety blue to violetish blue color with medium to medium-dark tones and strong to vivid saturation [56][62].
*   **Padparadscha Sapphire:** A rare and highly sought-after sapphire with a pinkish-orange to orangish-pink hue [65][11][66].
*   **Pink Sapphire:** A sapphire with a pink hue [40][53][66]. The line between a pink sapphire and a ruby can be subjective, with gemological labs like GIA often grading based on the dominant hue [57].
*   **Yellow Sapphire:** A sapphire with a yellow hue [40][53][66]. Vivid yellow sapphires with high saturation are considered to be of the highest quality [67].
*   **Green Sapphire:** A sapphire with a green hue [40][53][66].
*   **Purple Sapphire:** A sapphire with a purple hue [40][53]. The purple color can result from the presence of vanadium or a combination of chromium, titanium, and ferrous iron [38][63].
*   **Colorless Sapphire (Leucosapphire):** A sapphire that lacks color [53][66].
*   **Black Sapphire:** A sapphire that appears black [53][66]. The dark appearance can be caused by hematite inclusions, which can also create asterism (star effect) [62].
*   **Star Sapphire:** A sapphire exhibiting asterism, a star-like effect caused by inclusions [62][54][55]. Black star sapphires are one example [62].
Sapphires are cut in various styles to enhance their brilliance and color [7][68]. Common cuts include brilliant, step, and mixed cuts [7][68]. Specific shapes include round brilliant, oval, pear, princess, baguette, and cabochon cuts [69]. The quality of the cut significantly impacts the sapphire's value [70].

# Treatments and Enhancements

Sapphires are often subjected to various treatments to enhance their color and clarity [60]. Heat treatment is a common practice, involving heating the stones to high temperatures (up to 1800°C) in a controlled environment [71]. This process can improve or intensify the color of the sapphire [71]. The "Fancy Burn" method involves heating sapphires to over 1400 degrees Celsius in an oxygen-rich environment [71].
Besides heat treatment, other treatments exist. Exposing blue zircon to long-wave UV radiation can cause color modifications [72]. Some synthetic or lab-treated sapphires may contain inclusions like air bubbles or scratches [73]. A Be-thermodiffusion treatment can reduce TiO2 inclusions in corundum, which is then converted by iron [74]. Hydrothermal synthesis mimics natural formation by subjecting the minerals to intense heat and pressure [75].

# Synthetic Sapphires

Synthetic sapphires are manufactured forms of alumina oxide (Al2O3), the same mineral, corundum, that constitutes natural sapphires [25] [76]. The creation of synthetic sapphires became possible with the invention of a growth method from alumina melt by August Verneuil in 1904, known as the Verneuil method or flame fusion method [77].
Several methods exist for producing synthetic sapphires [78].
*   **Verneuil Method (Flame Fusion):** This involves melting the gemstone material using a high-temperature flame, resulting in the formation of pear-shaped crystals [77] [79].
*   **Czochralski Method (Fusion Pull-up Method):** Developed in the 1960s to improve optical quality, this method involves dipping a sapphire seed crystal into molten alumina and slowly pulling it upwards [80] [81].
*   **Kyropoulos Method:** Another method used for manufacturing single-crystal sapphire [80] [78].
*   **Heat Exchange Method (Melting Crucible):** This is yet another technique employed in the creation of synthetic sapphires [80] [78].
*   **Edge-defined Film-fed Growth (EFG):** A method used in the production of single crystal sapphire [80] [78].
*   **Hydrothermal Synthesis:** This solution process mimics natural sapphire formation by subjecting minerals to intense heat and pressure [76] [75]. Sapphires form around a seed crystal as the mineral solution rises [75].
*   **Flux Method:** Similar to hydrothermal synthesis, this method is used to create sapphires like Chatham sapphires [75].
Synthetic sapphires share the same chemical formula (Al2O3) and crystal structure (hexagonal) as their natural counterparts [82] [83] [29] [20]. They also possess similar physical properties, including hardness, chemical inertness, and thermal stability [25] [29]. However, lab-treated or synthetic sapphires may contain inclusions such as air bubbles or scratches [73].

# Imitations and Simulants

Due to the value and desirability of natural sapphires, various imitations and simulants exist in the market. These can range from natural materials that resemble sapphire to entirely synthetic creations [84]. Identifying genuine sapphires often involves careful examination for inclusions, which are internal flaws or imperfections [85][9]. These inclusions can take various forms, including needle-like rutile, wispy fingerprints, geometric crystals, and tiny gas bubbles [86]. Gemological testing and certification can also help determine authenticity [87].
Synthetic sapphires are created through several methods, including the Verneuil method, the Czochralski (Fusion Pull-up) method, the Kyropoulos method, the Heat Exchange Method, and the EFG method [80]. These processes involve melting and recrystallizing the necessary chemical components, such as sulfates, carbonates, or powdered metals [88].
The clarity of a sapphire, along with its color, is a key factor in determining its value [4]. Inclusions, while sometimes indicative of a natural stone, can also affect clarity [85]. It's important to note that certain inclusions, like "lily pads," are associated with other gemstones like peridot, while similar features in sapphire are called discoids [10]. Some sapphires undergo treatments, such as beryllium diffusion, which can be detected through gemological testing [89].

# Uses

Sapphires are highly versatile gemstones due to their exceptional durability, wide range of colors, and good thermal, electrical, and dielectric properties [34] [90]. These properties contribute to their use in both jewelry and industrial applications [34] [91].
Sapphires have been used in jewelry for centuries and are often associated with royalty and said to possess mystical powers [92]. The most popular cuts for sapphires in jewelry include oval, round, and cushion cuts, which are commonly used in rings, pendants, and earrings [93] [94]. Other cuts include the Asscher cut, radiant cut, pear cut, and baguette cut [95] [69] [96] [97]. The cut of a sapphire refers to the shape and arrangement of its facets, with the three basic styles being brilliant, step, and mixed cuts [68] [7]. The color of a sapphire is a significant factor in determining its value, with vivid and evenly saturated hues being the most desirable [98] [4]. Blue sapphires are the most well-known, but sapphires come in a wide range of colors [90] [98]. Some sapphires even exhibit color change under different lighting conditions [39].
In addition to jewelry, sapphires have various industrial applications due to their transparency, high optical properties, and resistance to chemical attack [34] [99] [91]. Synthetic sapphires are commonly used in these applications [91]. For example, sapphire windows are used in the F-35 Lightning 2 Electro Optical Targeting System [32]. The excellent thermal properties of sapphire also make it suitable for other demanding applications [34]. Methods for artificially manufacturing sapphire have been developed for over a century, and modern advances have allowed for higher quality and more consistent production [91]. These methods include the Verneuil method, the Czochralski (Fusion Pull-up) method, the Kyropoulos method, the Heat Exchange Method (HEM), and the Edge Fed Growth (EFG) method [80] [78].

# Cultural Significance

Sapphires have long been associated with royalty and are believed to possess mystical powers [92]. Throughout history, they have been prized for their beauty, durability, and perceived rarity [100]. Sapphires are even considered by some to be powerful healing stones with physical, mental, and spiritual effects [101]. The stones have been worn by royalty for centuries [92].

# Grading and Valuation

The grading and valuation of sapphires is a complex process that considers several key factors, often referred to as the "4 Cs": Color, Clarity, Cut, and Carat weight [102] [103] [70] [64]. An additional factor, "Country of Origin," is also sometimes considered [104]. Unlike diamonds, color plays the most significant role in determining a sapphire's value [105] [106] [107].

## Color

Color is the most important factor in determining a sapphire's value [105] [106] [61] [59] [107]. The ideal sapphire exhibits a pure, vivid hue [105]. Color is evaluated based on hue, saturation, and tone [61] [59]. While blue is the most well-known color for sapphires, they also occur in other colors, including pink, orange, yellow, green, purple, and violet, which are sometimes referred to as "fancy sapphires" [40] [53]. However, the term "fancy sapphires" typically excludes colorless, black, and blue sapphires [53]. Some sapphires can even change color under different lighting conditions, typically appearing blue-violet in daylight and purple or reddish under incandescent light [39]. This phenomenon is similar to that observed in alexandrite and is due to the sapphire's chemical composition [39] [108]. For yellow sapphires, a vivid yellow color with high saturation (70-100%) indicates the highest quality [67]. In blue sapphires, a "true" blue color is most desirable [64]. Color zoning, where there are angular zones of different shades of blue, can also occur [62]. Cutters sometimes orient the stone to accommodate and display the most concentrated color [62].

## Clarity

Clarity refers to the presence of inclusions within the sapphire [56] [4]. Sapphires are typically Type 2 gemstones, meaning they usually contain inclusions [109]. Common types of inclusions include needles, fingerprint inclusions (formed during recrystallization) [110], color zoning [111], cavities, feathers, liquid inclusions, and rutile needles [85] [86]. "Silk," which refers to fine, needle-like inclusions, is a well-known type of inclusion in sapphires [111]. While extremely high clarity is rare in blue sapphires [56], the type, size, and location of inclusions can affect the stone's value [85] [86].

## Cut

The cut of a sapphire refers to the shape and arrangement of its facets [70] [7] [68]. The basic cut types are brilliant, step, and mixed cuts [7] [68]. Poor cutting can lower a sapphire's grade, leading to light leakage [112]. Common cuts for sapphires include oval, round, and cushion cuts [93] [94]. Other cuts include baguette, princess, pear, asscher, and radiant cuts [69] [95]. The ideal cut maximizes the sapphire's brilliance and minimizes any flaws [70] [112].

## Carat Weight

Carat weight is a standard measure of a gemstone's weight, and larger sapphires are generally more valuable, assuming all other factors are equal [102] [103] [70] [64].

## Other Factors

Besides the 4Cs, the country of origin can also influence a sapphire's value [104]. Sapphires can also exhibit pleochroism, meaning they show different colors when viewed from different angles [5] [113].
