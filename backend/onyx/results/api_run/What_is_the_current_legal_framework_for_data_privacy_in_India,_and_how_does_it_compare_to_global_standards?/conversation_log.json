Here's a breakdown of some of the most important definitions:\n\n*   **Personal Data:** The DPDP Act defines \"personal data\" as any data about an individual who is identifiable by or in relation to such data [8] [28] [32] [33]. This means any information that can identify or relate to an individual falls under the purview of the Act [6] [30]. The Act applies to personal data in digital form, or data collected by other means and later digitized [3] [5]. It's important to note that the DPDP Act gives equal merit for protection to all digital personal data and does not define any data category as sensitive personal data or critical data [7] [29].\n\n*   **Data Principal:** The \"data principal\" is the individual to whom the personal data relates [13] [19] [20] [23]. In simpler terms, it's YOU [21]. The DPDP Act endows data principals with key rights to ensure their personal data is handled with respect and transparency [14]. The data principal also has certain duties outlined in the Act [17].\n\n*   **Data Fiduciary:** While the provided information doesn't explicitly define \"data fiduciary,\" it does mention their responsibilities. Data fiduciaries are responsible for determining the purpose and means of processing personal data [22]. They are also required to provide information to data principals when their data is processed based on prior consent [18]. The Board monitors compliance and can direct data fiduciaries to take necessary measures [2]. The Act permits data fiduciaries to transfer personal data to other countries unless the central government restricts it [10].", "user_utterance": "What are the key definitions outlined in the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act)?

Section 43A of the IT Act addresses data privacy by holding body corporates accountable for handling \"sensitive personal data\" [3] [24]. Section 72A provides punishment for intentionally disclosing personal information obtained during the provision of services [12] [28]. Section 66E addresses the invasion of privacy with potential imprisonment or fines [13]. The Act also enables the use of digital signatures for submitting important documents [25].\n\n*   **Cybersecurity Focus:** The IT Act empowers authorities to monitor and collect traffic data for cybersecurity purposes [1] [11]. It aims to protect internet users from data theft and other cybercrimes [33].\n\n*   **Limitations:** While the IT Act lays a foundation, it has limitations in providing comprehensive data protection. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP) has been introduced to address these gaps [6] [8] [16] [29]. The DPDP Act aims to make data processors more accountable and empower individuals with greater control over their personal data [6].\n\nIn summary, the IT Act, 2000, provides a basic legal framework for data privacy in India, particularly concerning electronic transactions and cybercrime. However, its provisions are limited in scope compared to modern comprehensive data protection laws like the DPDP Act [6] [8] [16] [29].", "user_utterance": "How does the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) currently address data privacy, and what are its limitations in providing comprehensive data protection?", "search_queries": ["query 1: Information Technology Act 2000 data privacy provisions", "query 2: IT Act 2000 limitations data privacy", "query 3: IT Act 2000 data protection India"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/13116/1/it_act_2000_updated.pdf", "description": "Power to authorise to monitor and collect traffic data or information through any computer resource for cyber security. 70.
