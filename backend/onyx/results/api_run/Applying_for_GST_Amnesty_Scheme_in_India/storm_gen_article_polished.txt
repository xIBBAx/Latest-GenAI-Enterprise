# summary

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Amnesty Scheme in India is a government initiative designed to reduce the compliance burden on taxpayers and boost revenue collection by offering relief from penalties and interest on outstanding GST liabilities [1][2]. Introduced to address challenges arising from the initial implementation of GST in 2017, the scheme aims to encourage compliance by allowing defaulters to settle overdue taxes and file returns with reduced late fees [3][4][5]. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) provides guidance and clarifications regarding the scheme's provisions through circulars and notifications [6][7].
The scheme primarily targets taxpayers who have defaulted on filing GST returns and have outstanding tax payments related to notices issued under Section 73 of the GST Act, covering cases not involving fraud [5][8][9]. To qualify, taxpayers must make full payment of the tax demanded and withdraw any pending appeals [10][11]. The scheme offers waivers of interest and penalties for specific financial years, particularly 2017-18 to 2019-20, conditional on settling the full tax demanded by the specified deadline [12][13].
Eligible taxpayers can apply for the scheme electronically by filing Form GST SPL-01 or SPL-02 on the common portal, providing details of the relevant notice or statement [14][15]. Key dates include the scheme's effective date of November 1, 2024, the deadline for full tax payment by March 31, 2025, and the application deadline of June 30, 2025 [16][17][18]. The legal framework for the scheme is established under Section 128A of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, 2017, introduced via the Finance Act (No. 2) of 2024 [12][19].
While the GST Amnesty Scheme aims to improve tax compliance and reduce litigation, its effectiveness is debated, with some questioning whether it truly provides relief or inadvertently rewards non-compliance [20]. The exclusion of erroneous refunds from the scheme and the complexities surrounding its scope and coverage have also been noted as potential limitations [16][21]. Despite these criticisms, the scheme represents a significant effort to streamline GST compliance and resolve outstanding tax disputes [22].

# Overview

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Amnesty Scheme in India is designed to reduce the compliance burden on individuals and businesses [1]. It aims to boost tax compliance and revenue collection by providing relief to taxpayers facing challenges, particularly those arising from the initial implementation of GST [2][3]. The scheme offers an opportunity for defaulters to adhere to tax regulations, thereby enhancing overall tax compliance [23]. The introduction of GST itself aimed to create a common market with uniform taxation, eliminate the cascading effect of taxes, simplify the taxation system, combine many indirect taxes into one, widen the tax base, and reduce tax evasion [24]. The Amnesty Scheme further supports these objectives by encouraging taxpayers to come into the system and improve return filing rates [4]. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) issues clarifications and circulars regarding the scheme's provisions [6][7].

# Eligibility Criteria

The GST Amnesty Scheme in India has specific eligibility criteria that taxpayers must meet to avail of its benefits [16] [25]. The scheme is designed to provide relief to taxpayers who have defaulted on filing GST returns and have outstanding tax payments [5] [26].
Generally, the scheme targets taxpayers who have faced challenges related to the implementation of GST since its inception in 2017 [5] [3].
*   **Outstanding Tax Payments:** The scheme is available to taxpayers with outstanding tax payments pertaining to notices issued under Section 73(1) or statements under Section 73(3) of the GST Act [8]. This typically covers cases not involving fraud [9].
*   **Full Tax Payment:** To qualify for the waiver of interest and penalties, taxpayers must make full payment of the tax demanded in the notice or order [10] [17] [27]. The deadline for full tax payment is typically set for March 31, 2025 [26].
*   **Withdrawal of Appeals:** A primary condition for availing the scheme is the withdrawal of any pending appeals before appellate authorities, tribunals, or courts [11] [10] [28]. Taxpayers who wish to apply under Section 128A may need to apply to the appellate authority first to withdraw their appeal [11]. Form GST APL-01 is used for filing appeals under this scheme [29].

However, there are exclusions to the scheme. Erroneous refunds are generally excluded [16]. It's important to note that the benefit of the amnesty scheme can be availed even where the demand under notice or order pertains only to interest and/or penalty, other than interest on self-assessed tax [7].

# Impact and Effectiveness

GST amnesty schemes in India aim to reduce the compliance burden for individuals and businesses [1]. These schemes are typically introduced to boost tax compliance and revenue collection by providing opportunities for taxpayers to settle outstanding issues [2]. Chartered Accountants play a vital role in this process due to their knowledge of business, accounting, and professional approach [44].
One key benefit of these schemes is bringing more taxpayers into the system, which in turn can improve return filing rates [4]. For example, an Amnesty Scheme was implemented to provide relief to taxpayers affected by technical difficulties between 2017-18 and 2019-20 [3]. These schemes promote compliance among defaulters by encouraging adherence to tax regulations, leading to a more stable and predictable revenue stream [3].
The GST collections have seen significant increases, such as the 12.6% year-on-year rise in April 2025, reaching ₹2.37 lakh crore, the highest monthly collection ever [45][46]. Schemes like the one effective from November 1, 2024, aim to reduce litigation and expedite the setup of the GST Appellate Tribunal [40]. Provisions are often included to waive outstanding interest and penalties for specific financial years, conditional on the taxpayer settling the principal amount [12].
However, the effectiveness of these schemes is debated, with some analyses questioning whether they truly provide relief or inadvertently reward non-compliance [20]. Some schemes offer conditional deemed withdrawal of best judgment assessment orders in past cases, providing relief to taxpayers who could not file previously [47]. The reintroduction of tax amnesty schemes has been encouraged by past successes, sometimes including relaxations on lease payments to group companies and penalty waivers [48]. Eligibility criteria and procedures are usually outlined, with exclusions for erroneous refunds and specific cases [16].

# Criticism and Challenges

While the GST Amnesty Scheme aims to reduce the compliance burden and boost tax collection [1][2], it also faces potential criticisms and challenges. One area of concern revolves around the consistent updating of information, with some arguing that failure to do so should be treated as a minor breach under Section 126, warranting warnings rather than penalties [49]. Taxpayers and stakeholders may also face issues or problems that require lodging complaints [50]. The scheme's effectiveness in addressing technical difficulties and teething troubles experienced by taxpayers during the initial implementation of GST (2017-18 to 2019-20) is also a point of consideration [3]. Furthermore, the scheme's scope and coverage, particularly concerning Section 128A of the CGST Act 2017, recommendations from the 54th GST Council Meeting, and related guidelines, may present complexities [21]. The exclusion of erroneous refunds from the amnesty scheme [16] may also be viewed as a limitation.

# Legal Framework

The GST Amnesty Scheme in India is established under Section 128A of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, 2017 [12][21][19][52].
