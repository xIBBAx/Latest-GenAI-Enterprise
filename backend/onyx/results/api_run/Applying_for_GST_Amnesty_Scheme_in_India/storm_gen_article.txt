# Overview

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Amnesty Scheme in India is designed to reduce the compliance burden on individuals and businesses [1]. It aims to boost tax compliance and revenue collection by providing relief to taxpayers facing challenges, particularly those arising from the initial implementation of GST [2][3]. The scheme offers an opportunity for defaulters to adhere to tax regulations, thereby enhancing overall tax compliance [4]. The introduction of GST itself aimed to create a common market with uniform taxation, eliminate the cascading effect of taxes, simplify the taxation system, combine many indirect taxes into one, widen the tax base, and reduce tax evasion [5]. The Amnesty Scheme further supports these objectives by encouraging taxpayers to come into the system and improve return filing rates [6]. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) issues clarifications and circulars regarding the scheme's provisions [7][8].

# Eligibility Criteria

The GST Amnesty Scheme in India has specific eligibility criteria that taxpayers must meet to avail of its benefits [9] [10]. The scheme is designed to provide relief to taxpayers who have defaulted on filing GST returns and have outstanding tax payments [11] [12].
Generally, the scheme targets taxpayers who have faced challenges related to the implementation of GST since its inception in 2017 [11] [3].
*   **Outstanding Tax Payments:** The scheme is available to taxpayers with outstanding tax payments pertaining to notices issued under Section 73(1) or statements under Section 73(3) of the GST Act [13]. This typically covers cases not involving fraud [14].
*   **Full Tax Payment:** To qualify for the waiver of interest and penalties, taxpayers must make full payment of the tax demanded in the notice or order [15] [16] [17]. The deadline for full tax payment is typically set for March 31, 2025 [12].
*   **Withdrawal of Appeals:** A primary condition for availing the scheme is the withdrawal of any pending appeals before appellate authorities, tribunals, or courts [18] [15] [19]. Taxpayers who wish to apply under Section 128A may need to apply to the appellate authority first to withdraw their appeal [18]. Form GST APL-01 is used for filing appeals under this scheme [20].
*   **Eligible Persons:** Any person liable to pay tax chargeable is considered eligible for the waiver scheme [21].
*   **Specific Return Defaults:** The GST Amnesty Scheme was introduced to provide relief to taxpayers who missed filing GSTR-3B for previous tax periods [12]. It also covers defaults in filing other GST returns such as GSTR-1 and GSTR-4 within a specified period from the issuance of the assessment order [12].
However, there are exclusions to the scheme. Erroneous refunds are generally excluded [9]. It's important to note that the benefit of the amnesty scheme can be availed even where the demand under notice or order pertains only to interest and/or penalty, other than interest on self-assessed tax [8].

# Scheme Details

The GST Amnesty Scheme in India is a government initiative designed to provide relief to taxpayers by reducing or waiving penalties and interest on overdue taxes [2]. The objective of the scheme is to reduce the compliance burden for individuals and businesses [1], and to encourage compliance with GST regulations by allowing defaulters to file overdue returns with reduced late fees [2]. The scheme is effective from November 1, 2024 [9].
The Amnesty Scheme aims to provide relief to taxpayers affected by teething troubles and technical difficulties [3]. It includes provisions to waive outstanding interest and penalties for specific financial years, provided the qualifying taxpayer settles the full tax demanded [22]. This conditional waiver is implemented under Section 128A of the CGST Act [23], as inserted vide Finance Act, 2024 [24]. Notification No. 20/2024 – Central Tax, dated October 8, 2024, specifies the date on or before which the full payment of tax demanded must be paid [24]. The deadline for full tax payment under the scheme is March 31, 2025 [16][25].
The scheme primarily targets waivers of interest and penalties related to tax demands raised under Section 73 of the CGST Act for the financial years 2017-18 to 2019-20 [26]. It offers a complete waiver of interest and penalties for specified non-fraudulent GST demand notices [23]. However, certain cases are excluded from the scheme, such as those involving erroneous refunds [9]. The benefit of the amnesty scheme can be availed where the demand under notice or order pertains only to interest and/or penalty, other than interest on self-assessed tax [8].
To apply for a waiver under the amnesty scheme, eligible persons can file an application electronically in Form GST SPL-01 on the common portal, providing details of the notice or statement [27]. Form GST SPL-02 is used to apply for a waiver of penalty, interest, or both levied by the authority as part of a tax demand [28][29][30]. Taxpayers are required to make payments for all disputed issues through one [31], and the entire tax amount as mentioned in the notice must be paid on or before March 31, 2025 [16].

# Application Procedure

Eligible individuals can apply for the GST Amnesty Scheme electronically by filing Form GST SPL-01 on the common portal [27].

**Steps for Applying (SPL-02):**
1.  Log into the GST portal [28].
2.  Navigate to the relevant section for filing applications [32].
GSTN has provided clarifications regarding the conditions for Indian taxpayers utilizing the GST Amnesty Scheme before the deadline [33]. An alternative mechanism for filing applications under the Amnesty Scheme governed by Section 128A has also been announced [34].
**Form GST SPL01:**
Table 7 of the GST SPL01 form requires the submission of documents related to the demand order or order in appeal [9]. The scheme is effective from November 1, 2024, and has specific eligibility criteria and procedures [9]. It's important to note that the scheme excludes erroneous refunds [9]. Taxpayers with outstanding tax payments pertaining to notices under Section 73(1) or statements under Section 73(3) are generally eligible [13]. According to the scheme, waivers of interest and penalties are permitted upon full tax payment; however, payments for all disputed issues must be made through one transaction [31]. The deadline to utilize the GST Amnesty Scheme is June 30, 2025 [33].

# Important Dates

The GST Amnesty Scheme, introduced under the Finance (No. 2) Act 2024, has specific deadlines that taxpayers must adhere to in order to benefit from the waiver of interest and penalties [35]. The scheme is effective from November 1, 2024 [36][9].
Taxpayers must pay the full principal tax demand by March 31, 2025 [3][15][16]. The deadline to apply for the scheme is June 30, 2025 [3][37][38][39]. Taxpayers can submit a screenshot of their appeal withdrawal application to become eligible for the scheme [37][38].

# Impact and Effectiveness

GST amnesty schemes in India aim to reduce the compliance burden for individuals and businesses [1]. These schemes are typically introduced to boost tax compliance and revenue collection by providing opportunities for taxpayers to settle outstanding issues [2]. Chartered Accountants play a vital role in this process due to their knowledge of business, accounting, and professional approach [40].
One key benefit of these schemes is bringing more taxpayers into the system, which in turn can improve return filing rates [6]. For example, an Amnesty Scheme was implemented to provide relief to taxpayers affected by technical difficulties between 2017-18 and 2019-20 [3]. These schemes promote compliance among defaulters by encouraging adherence to tax regulations, leading to a more stable and predictable revenue stream [3].
The GST collections have seen significant increases, such as the 12.6% year-on-year rise in April 2025, reaching ₹2.37 lakh crore, the highest monthly collection ever [41][42]. Schemes like the one effective from November 1, 2024, aim to reduce litigation and expedite the setup of the GST Appellate Tribunal [36]. Provisions are often included to waive outstanding interest and penalties for specific financial years, conditional on the taxpayer settling the principal amount [22].
However, the effectiveness of these schemes is debated, with some analyses questioning whether they truly provide relief or inadvertently reward non-compliance [43]. Some schemes offer conditional deemed withdrawal of best judgment assessment orders in past cases, providing relief to taxpayers who could not file previously [44]. The reintroduction of tax amnesty schemes has been encouraged by past successes, sometimes including relaxations on lease payments to group companies and penalty waivers [45]. Eligibility criteria and procedures are usually outlined, with exclusions for erroneous refunds and specific cases [9].

# Criticism and Challenges

While the GST Amnesty Scheme aims to reduce the compliance burden and boost tax collection [1][2], it also faces potential criticisms and challenges. One area of concern revolves around the consistent updating of information, with some arguing that failure to do so should be treated as a minor breach under Section 126, warranting warnings rather than penalties [46]. Taxpayers and stakeholders may also face issues or problems that require lodging complaints [47]. The scheme's effectiveness in addressing technical difficulties and teething troubles experienced by taxpayers during the initial implementation of GST (2017-18 to 2019-20) is also a point of consideration [3]. Furthermore, the scheme's scope and coverage, particularly concerning Section 128A of the CGST Act 2017, recommendations from the 54th GST Council Meeting, and related guidelines, may present complexities [48]. The exclusion of erroneous refunds from the amnesty scheme [9] may also be viewed as a limitation.

# Related Schemes and Initiatives

These schemes provide an opportunity for taxpayers to settle pending tax disputes without additional financial burdens by waiving interest and penalties, encouraging voluntary compliance and dispute resolution [49]. The objective of such schemes is to reduce the compliance burden of individuals and businesses [1].
Specifically, the Amnesty Scheme in India aimed to provide relief to taxpayers affected by teething troubles and technical difficulties related to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) [3]. This scheme was introduced to assist taxpayers, including small enterprises, who needed to file their GST returns on time [50]. It also minimizes the administrative burden of managing non-fraud cases while enabling the government to lower fines and late fees [50]. The GSTN has clarified the conditions for Indian taxpayers looking to utilize the GST Amnesty Scheme [33].

# Legal Framework

The GST Amnesty Scheme in India is established under Section 128A of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, 2017 [22][48][51][52]. This section was introduced via the Finance Act (No. 2) of 2024 to provide taxpayers with an opportunity to waive interest and penalties related to GST [51][24]. The scheme is further supported by Rule 164 of the CGST Act [52][26]. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) implements and clarifies the provisions of the scheme through circulars and notifications [8][53][12][54]. These notifications and circulars often amend existing rules and provide clarifications regarding the scheme's applicability [54][55][56]. The scheme is designed to reduce litigation and expedite the setup of the GST Appellate Tribunal [36].
