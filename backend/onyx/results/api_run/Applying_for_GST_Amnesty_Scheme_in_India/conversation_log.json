Primarily, it aimed to provide relief to taxpayers who had not filed their returns on time or had made errors in compliance [6]. This relief was specifically targeted towards those who missed filing GSTR-3B for previous tax periods [4]. Recognizing the challenges and \"teething troubles\" businesses faced since the inception of GST in July 2017, particularly from FY 2017-18 to FY 2019-20, the scheme aimed to alleviate the burden caused by technical difficulties [7] [15].\n\nOne of the main benefits of the scheme is to provide a one-time waiver of late fees, enabling defaulters to file their overdue returns without incurring hefty penalties [15]. The scheme also aimed to reduce the compliance burden on individuals and businesses [10]. By offering extended deadlines, simplified procedures, and financial relief, the GST Amnesty Scheme encourages businesses to settle outstanding dues and ensure smoother compliance [26]. It further supports taxpayers in addressing backlogs [26]. The GST Amnesty Scheme is enacted vide Finance (No. 2) Act 2024 (No. 15 of 2024) dated 16th August 2024 [5].", "user_utterance": "What were the primary objectives the government aimed to achieve by introducing the GST Amnesty Scheme?", "search_queries": ["Here are some Google search queries I would use to answer the question about the primary objectives of the GST Amnesty Scheme in India:", "", "query 1: GST Amnesty Scheme objectives"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://d23z1tp9il9etb.cloudfront.net/download/pdf25/E-Newsletter%20on%20GST-53rd%20Edition.pdf", "description": "31 May 2025 \u2014 OIDAR provisions seek to levy tax in the hands of supplier located in the non-taxable territory (i.e. outside India) for provision of OIDAR ...", "snippets": ["31 May 2025 \u2014 OIDAR provisions seek to levy tax in the hands of supplier located in the non-taxable territory (i.e. outside India) for provision of OIDAR ..."], "title": "ICAI-GST - Cloudfront.net", "meta": {"query": "Here are some Google search queries I would use to answer the question about the primary objectives of the GST Amnesty Scheme in India:"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, {"url": "https://quizlet.com/877544210/internet-rater-exam-flash-cards/", "description": "Study with Quizlet and memorize flashcards containing terms like True, Dominant, Common and more.", "snippets": ["Study with Quizlet and memorize flashcards containing terms like True, Dominant, Common and more."], "title": "Internet Rater Exam Flashcards | Quizlet", "meta": {"query": "Here are some Google search queries I would use to answer the question about the primary objectives of the GST Amnesty Scheme in India:"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, {"url": "https://m.economictimes.com/wealth/tax/new-update-on-gst-amnesty-scheme-waiver-of-penalty-and-interest-these-taxpayers-need-to-apply-to-appellate-authority-first-to-withdraw-the-appeal-and-then-apply-for-the-scheme/articleshow/117241212.cms", "description": "14 Jan 2025 \u2014 New update on GST Amnesty Scheme waiver of penalty and interest: These taxpayers need to withdraw their appeal and then apply for the scheme.", "snippets": ["14 Jan 2025 \u2014 New update on GST Amnesty Scheme waiver of penalty and interest: These taxpayers need to withdraw their appeal and then apply for the scheme."], "title": "New update on GST Amnesty Scheme waiver of penalty ...", "meta": {"query": "Here are some Google search queries I would use to answer the question about the primary objectives of the GST Amnesty Scheme in India:"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, {"url": "https://cleartax.in/s/gst-amnesty-scheme", "description": "The GST Amnesty Scheme was introduced by the government to provide relief to taxpayers who missed filing GSTR-3B for the previous tax periods.

Introduced by the government, the scheme aims to reduce litigation and the administrative burden of managing non-fraud cases [9] [26]. Specifically, it targets those who missed filing their GSTR-3B returns for previous tax periods [5] [31].\n\nSeveral sources highlight key objectives:\n\n*   **Waiver of penalties and interest:** A major aim is to waive interest and penalties on specified non-fraudulent GST demands, offering a conditional waiver under Section 128A of the CGST Act [1] [8] [9] [21]. The scheme provides a one-time waiver of late fees, enabling defaulters to file overdue returns without incurring hefty penalties [7].

Here's a breakdown:\n\n1.  **Eligibility and Deadlines:**\n\n    *   To qualify for the scheme, taxpayers must fully pay their outstanding principal tax dues by March 31, 2025 [1] [3] [15] [16].\n    *   The deadline to apply for the amnesty scheme was June 30, 2025 [3] [15] [28]. Missing either deadline could result in losing the amnesty benefits [3] [15].\n\n2.  **Application Procedure:**\n\n    *   Log in to the GST portal [2] [18] [26] [30].\n    *   Navigate to \"My Applications\" under \"Services\" and then \"User Services\" [4] [22] [30].\n    *   Select \"Apply for Waiver. Scheme under Section 128A\" under the \"Application Type\" dropdown [4] [22].\n    *   Eligible individuals can electronically file an application in Form GST SPL-01 on the common portal, including details of the relevant notice or statement [20].\n    *   Alternatively, taxpayers can apply for a waiver using form GST SPL-02 [2] [6] [18] [26]. This form is specifically for cases where a demand order or order in appeal has already been passed by tax authorities [32].\n\n3.  **Forms and Documentation:**\n\n    *   Use Form GST APL-01 to file appeals under this scheme, especially if facing GST demand orders under Section 107(1) of the GST Act [5] [33].\n    *   Taxpayers must withdraw any pending appeals before applying for the amnesty scheme [10].\n    *   Submit necessary documentation via Forms GST SPL-01 or SPL-02 [10].\n    *   Table 7 of GST SPL01 provides details regarding the documents required for waiver applications where a demand order or order in appeal has been passed [25].\n    *   A screenshot of the appeal withdrawal application may also be required [19].\n\n4.  **Manual Submission (if needed):**\n\n    *   A recent advisory introduced a manual submission option for Section 128A CGST amnesty scheme applicants [17] [29]. This helps taxpayers bypass potential issues with online submission.\n\n5.  **Post-Application:**\n\n    *   You may be able to file an appeal against the GST Amnesty Scheme order issued in SPL 07 form [9].\n    *   SPL-03 is relevant within three months of filing SPL-01/02 [14] [28].\n\nThe GST Amnesty Scheme aims to provide relief to taxpayers facing difficulties in meeting compliance requirements or dealing with procedural shortcomings [23]. It also assists those whose GST registration was canceled due to the non-filing of tax returns [11] [13].", "user_utterance": "What is the application process for the GST Amnesty Scheme?", "search_queries": ["query 1: GST Amnesty Scheme application process", "query 2: How to apply for GST Amnesty Scheme India", "query 3: GST Amnesty Scheme online application"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://cleartax.in/s/gst-amnesty-scheme", "description": "15 Jun 2025 \u2014 To qualify, taxpayers must fully pay outstanding tax dues by 31st March 2025. 7 February 2025.

The scheme is designed to provide relief to taxpayers who have not filed their returns on time or have made errors in compliance ( [13]).\n\nHere's a breakdown of eligibility, based on the provided information:\n\n*   **Taxpayers with Overdue GST:** The scheme primarily targets taxpayers with overdue GST, who have missed filing returns for certain tax periods ( [15], [23]).\n*   **Demand Orders:** The amnesty scheme is applicable for taxpayers facing GST demand orders specifically under Section 107(1) of the GST Act ( [23]).\n*   **Section 73 of the CGST Act:** The GST Amnesty Scheme 2024 offers a waiver of interest and penalties for tax demands under Section 73 of the CGST Act for the period between July 2017 and March 2020 ( [17]).\n*   **Conditional Waiver:** The GST Amnesty Scheme introduced via Section 128A provides a conditional waiver of interest and penalties for tax demands from FY 2017-18 to 2019-20 ( [31]).\n*   **Full Tax Payment:** To avail the amnesty scheme, the full amount of tax demanded in the notice/statement/order must be paid ( [25]). The GST Amnesty Scheme under Section 128A grants a total waiver of pending interest and penalty if the eligible taxpayer pays the tax dispute amount ( [22]).\n\nIt's important to note that taxpayers wishing to apply for the GST Amnesty Scheme under Section 128A might need to apply to the appellate authority first to withdraw any pending appeals ( [6]). The scheme is effective from November 1, 2024, and outlines specific eligibility criteria and procedures ( [8], [28]). Taxpayers can apply for a waiver under the amnesty scheme using form SPL-02 ( [2], [11], [19], [24]). The GST Amnesty Scheme was introduced to provide relief to taxpayers who missed filing GSTR-3B for previous tax periods ( [20]).", "user_utterance": "What are the specific eligibility criteria for businesses to apply for the GST Amnesty Scheme?", "search_queries": ["Here are some Google search queries I would use to find the specific eligibility criteria for businesses to apply for the GST Amnesty Scheme in India:", "", "query 1: GST Amnesty Scheme eligibility criteria"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://www.centaxonline.com/blog/gstn-offers-alternate-filing-route-for-amnesty-applications-u-s-128a", "description": "13 Jun 2025 \u2014 GSTN has released an important advisory announcing an alternative mechanism for filing applications under the Amnesty Scheme governed by Section 128A of the ...", "snippets": ["13 Jun 2025 \u2014 GSTN has released an important advisory announcing an alternative mechanism for filing applications under the Amnesty Scheme governed by Section 128A of the ..."], "title": "GSTN Offers Alternate Filing Route for Amnesty Applications u/s 128A", "meta": {"query": "Here are some Google search queries I would use to find the specific eligibility criteria for businesses to apply for the GST Amnesty Scheme in India:"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, {"url": "https://cleartax.in/s/gst-form-spl-02", "description": "26 Mar 2025 \u2014 Here is the step-by-step process for applying for a waiver under the amnesty scheme using SPL-02.
